# Case Prep

The Case Prep series distills go-to operative steps, anatomy pearls, and pimp questions for high-yield surgical scenarios. Each case page now includes a community contribution form so the playbook continues to evolve alongside modern practice.

## How to share an update

1. Open the specific case page you want to refine.
2. Scroll to the "Submit an Update" form beneath the canonical content.
3. Add refreshed operative steps, rapid-fire questions, anatomy pearls, or attending comments. Markdown formatting is supported for bullets and emphasis.
4. Hit **Submit Update** to send it for review.

## What happens next?

- **Moderation cadence:** New submissions are reviewed in batches every Friday. Expect approved updates to publish within 7 days of submission.
- **Notification:** Staticman does not automatically email status changes. If you include an email, it is only used for follow-up questions from the editorial team.
- **Approval standard:** Updates should cite contemporary practice patterns, highlight safety pearls, or clarify decision points. Submissions that lack clear educational value may be declined.

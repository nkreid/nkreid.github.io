  <p>Neil Koby Reid grew up in Lakewood, CA, before receiving his bachelor’s degree in biophysics and master’s in biomedical engineering from the University of Southern California. While at USC, he worked in the Brain-Body Dynamics Lab on tendon-driven robots and neuromuscular motor control in athletes. Later, Koby discovered an interest in operations improvement and worked with Los Angeles County Hospital to develop a quality management tool to track surgical site infections.
   </p>
   <p>He is interested in rural general surgery, emergency medicine, and family medicine and has an interest in distributing healthcare to people in remote locations. Whether through telesurgery for patients in rural towns, portable medical devices for backcountry hikers, or running a code on an astronaut in space, he says he wants to find logistical and technological solutions for delivering medical care in austere environments. Most recently, he has been developing a low-resource surgical kit that was presented at NASA’s Human Research Program’s annual meeting and is exploring its applications in disaster relief and global surgery.  
  </p>
  <p>Koby enjoys backpacking, fishing, and cooking when he’s not busy with school and appropriately holds an officer position in Texas A&M’s Wilderness Medicine Interest Group. You’ll often find him dashing around the country on his breaks from school to check off all the national parks from his list. When sticking around Houston, he enjoys grilling over open fires in his backyard and playing frisbee golf at his favorite local courses.

    My name is Neil Koby Reid.  <br />
    I build robots, research the brain-body connection, and teach kids math.  <br />
    And for those wondering, teaching is by far the most challenging.

  <p>As a child, I was puzzled by the hypoxic environments that caused my nausea on mountain roads and the forces required to fracture my clavicle playing football. After one introductory physics course, I could easily explain what happened, but I never felt like I had solved the problem. In hindsight, my change of major to biophysics was my subconscious gravitating back towards medicine, but I struggled to find the link between biology and physics that drew me to the name. I was not interested in the kinetics of motor proteins or chemotaxis in E. Coli â€“ I was fascinated with the human body's ability to survive. From the regulation of gases in deep-sea dives to the reduction of low gravity effects in space exploration, humans have exceeded their physiologic potential. These questions that picked my brain were interdisciplinary in nature. I was not satisfied with the answer from the physicist, the biologist, or even the physician. But the answer I pieced together from the three was exactly what I was looking for.

Many people dream of becoming a physician, but I never thought of myself as one of them. I am passionate about medicine, and I know I want to work with patients daily, but I was scared that I would have to give up my engineering background to be a physician. As I got older, I began to see engineering in medicine prevail. I remember seeing video calls with neurologists in the E.D. and first thought it would never catch on. Two years later, the entire healthcare system moved to telemedicine in a week because of COVID. I remember reading about a pediatric orthopedist who 3D prints copies of his patient's bones to show his young patients how he can fix them. These are just two experiences that made me realize that my interests weren't mutually exclusive. I didn't need to sacrifice my love for finding new solutions because I wanted to be a physician.

As a senior at USC, I began an M.S. in Biomedical Engineering to develop my technical skills before planning to embark on a career in medicine.  I knew a physics and engineering background would create a completely new kind of doctor, and I couldn't pass up the opportunity of an accelerated program. Fortunately, I have been accepted to the perfect medical school to continue this hybrid training. Texas A&M's EnMed program is the first of its kind, offering an M.D. degree and M.Eng. degree intertwined into one program. This program will further develop the problem-solving skills that I value in engineering while preparing me for a future with individual patients. I'm only at the start of my journey, but I look forward to the future and all the opportunities it may bring.

<p>I am currently a student at the University of Southern California where I am working on my master's in Biomedical Engineering. Prior to this I spent my undergradute getting a bachelors in Biophysics with a minor in Health Care Studies. I have been accepted to medical school to start Fall 2021 and I am working in a medical device start-up alongside my current work as a tutor.

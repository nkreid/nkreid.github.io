difficulty: "Core"
time_goal: "Pre-clinic run-through"
attending_notes: "Prefers Lichtenstein repair with lightweight mesh and ilioinguinal nerve preservation."
patient_profile: "60-year-old male with symptomatic right inguinal hernia, primary repair."
high_yield_pearls:
  - "Identify and protect ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and genital branch of genitofemoral nerves."
  - "Reduce hernia sac completely and ligate indirect sac at the internal ring."
  - "Ensure mesh overlaps pubic tubercle by at least 2 cm to prevent medial recurrence."
workflow_steps:
  - "Incision over inguinal canal and expose external oblique aponeurosis."
  - "Open external oblique, deliver cord structures, and identify hernia sac."
  - "Reduce or ligate sac, repair floor if direct defect, and size mesh."
  - "Secure mesh to pubic tubercle, inguinal ligament, and conjoined tendon with appropriate slit for cord."
  - "Close external oblique, Scarpa, and skin; consider ilioinguinal nerve block."
preop_checklist:
  - "Confirm no anticoagulation or plan perioperative management."
  - "Mark side and review prior repairs or recurrences."
  - "Discuss mesh type and fixation plan with attending."
pimp_questions:
  - question: "What are the contents of the spermatic cord?"
    answer: "Vas deferens, testicular artery, pampiniform plexus, cremasteric vessels, genital branch of genitofemoral nerve."
  - question: "How do you manage an incidental femoral hernia?"
    answer: "Reduce sac and place mesh to cover the femoral canal; consider preperitoneal reinforcement."

## Basic Anatomy
- Inguinal canal runs from deep ring (lateral to inferior epigastric vessels) to superficial ring at external oblique aponeurosis.
- Hesselbach's triangle is bounded by rectus abdominis medially, inferior epigastric vessels laterally, and inguinal ligament inferiorly.
- Femoral canal lies below inguinal ligament, medial to femoral vein—inspect for concurrent femoral hernia.

## Simplified Steps
1. Make an oblique incision over the inguinal canal, dissect down to external oblique, and open the aponeurosis in line with fibers.
2. Mobilize cord structures, protect nerves, and isolate direct or indirect hernia sacs.
3. Reduce direct defects with reinforcement sutures; ligate indirect sac high at the internal ring.
4. Size mesh with slit for cord, secure to pubic tubercle, inguinal ligament, and conjoined tendon ensuring no tension.
5. Close external oblique, perform ilioinguinal nerve block, and close subcutaneous tissue and skin.

## Postoperative Priorities
- Encourage early ambulation, limit lifting >10 lbs for 4–6 weeks.
- Manage pain with multimodal therapy; consider nerve block for persistent neuralgia.
- Evaluate for urinary retention before discharge, especially in older males.

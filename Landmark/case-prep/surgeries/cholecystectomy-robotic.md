high_yield_pearls:
  - "Dock from the patient's right shoulder to keep robotic arms off the diaphragm."
  - "Use Firefly to confirm cystic duct anatomy before division."
  - "Take time to reposition retractors when the gallbladder is intrahepatic to avoid traction tears."
workflow_steps:
  - "Position in reverse Trendelenburg with left tilt, dock robot from the right."
  - "Grasp fundus with third arm and retract infundibulum laterally."
  - "Dissect peritoneum to expose cystic duct and artery; perform Firefly cholangiography if available."
  - "Clip or stapler the cystic duct and artery with robotic instruments."
  - "Peel gallbladder off liver bed and retrieve in bag through assistant port."

pimp_questions:
  - question: "How does Firefly assist during cholecystectomy?"
    answer: "Indocyanine green highlights biliary anatomy, improving duct identification and reducing bile duct injury risk."
  - question: "When should you convert to an open approach?"
    answer: "If anatomy remains unclear after additional exposure, or if there is uncontrolled bleeding or suspected duct injury."

## Basic Anatomy
- The cystic plate forms the interface between gallbladder and liver; maintain dissection on the gallbladder to avoid hepatic bleeding.
- Cystic duct joins the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct; aberrant ducts may run in the hepatocystic triangle.
- The cystic artery may have anterior and posterior branchesâ€”clip both before division.

## Simplified Steps
1. Dock the robot after placing four ports and establishing reverse Trendelenburg position.
2. Retract fundus cephalad and infundibulum laterally with robotic arms to expose Calot's triangle.
3. Dissect peritoneum, identify cystic structures, and confirm anatomy with near-infrared imaging.
4. Clip and divide cystic artery then cystic duct, ensuring the critical view of safety.
5. Remove the gallbladder from the liver bed, irrigate, and remove the specimen in a bag.

## Postoperative Priorities
- Monitor for bile leak or bleeding; low threshold for postoperative labs in high-risk patients.
- Resume diet slowly, encourage incentive spirometry, and ambulate early.
- Arrange follow-up for pathology discussion and incision checks, especially at the 12 mm assistant port.

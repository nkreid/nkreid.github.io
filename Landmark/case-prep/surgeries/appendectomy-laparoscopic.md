## Basic Anatomy
- Appendix arises from the posteromedial cecum approximately 2 cm below the ileocecal valve.
- The appendiceal artery (branch of ileocolic) travels within the mesoappendix.
- Taeniae coli converge at the appendiceal baseâ€”use them to locate the stump.

## Simplified Steps
1. Establish pneumoperitoneum, place trocars under direct vision, and survey the abdomen.
2. Mobilize the appendix by dividing adhesions and tensioning the tip toward the anterior abdominal wall.
3. Control the mesoappendix and appendiceal artery with energy device or stapler.
4. Seal and divide the appendiceal base flush with the cecum.
5. Irrigate, ensure hemostasis, and remove the specimen via a retrieval bag before desufflation.

## Postoperative Priorities
- Advance diet as tolerated when nausea resolves; discharge once tolerating oral intake and pain is controlled on oral medications.
- Educate on wound care and signs of intra-abdominal abscess.
- Arrange follow-up within two weeks to review pathology and wound status.

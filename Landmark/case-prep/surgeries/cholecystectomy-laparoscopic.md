difficulty: "Core"
time_goal: "10-minute dry run"
attending_notes: "Insists on a formal critical view photo before clipping."
patient_profile: "42-year-old with biliary colic and normal anatomy on ultrasound."
high_yield_pearls:
  - "Clear the hepatocystic triangle entirely to expose the cystic duct and artery entering the gallbladder."
  - "Stay on the gallbladder during fundus-down dissection to protect the common bile duct."
  - "Control bleeding from the gallbladder bed with cautery and avoid deep bites into the liver."
workflow_steps:
  - "Achieve pneumoperitoneum and place four ports in American or French configuration."
  - "Retract the fundus cephalad and infundibulum laterally to open the hepatocystic triangle."
  - "Dissect peritoneum off Calot's triangle, identify cystic duct and artery, and obtain the critical view."
  - "Clip and divide cystic duct followed by cystic artery."
  - "Dissect gallbladder off the liver bed, control hemostasis, and extract in retrieval bag."
preop_checklist:
  - "Verify LFTs and imaging; confirm no suspicion for malignancy or Mirizzi."
  - "Ensure cholangiogram supplies are in the room if needed."
  - "Mark allergies and antibiotic prophylaxis preferences."
pimp_questions:
  - question: "What defines the critical view of safety?"
    answer: "Only two structures entering the gallbladder with cystic plate exposed and hepatocystic triangle cleared."
  - question: "How do you manage a suspected bile duct injury intraoperatively?"
    answer: "Leave drains, control bile leak, and obtain early hepatobiliary consultation."

attending_specific_comments:
  - "Prefers routine cholangiogram if duct diameter >6 mm."
  - "Requests infiltration with local anesthetic at all port sites before closure."

## Basic Anatomy
- Cystic duct drains into the common bile duct; the cystic artery usually branches from the right hepatic artery.
- The gallbladder fossa lies between segments IVb and V of the liver.
- The Rouviere sulcus marks the plane of the bile ductâ€”stay above this line during dissection.

## Simplified Steps
1. Establish pneumoperitoneum and position the patient in reverse Trendelenburg with left tilt.
2. Retract the fundus cephalad and infundibulum laterally to expose the hepatocystic triangle.
3. Skeletonize cystic duct and artery, confirm the critical view, then clip and divide.
4. Remove the gallbladder from the liver bed with cautery, controlling bleeding as needed.
5. Irrigate, check for bile leakage, and remove the specimen in a bag through the umbilical port.

## Postoperative Priorities
- Advance diet as tolerated; most patients can be discharged same day.
- Manage pain with multimodal regimen and encourage early ambulation.
- Review pathology and warn patients about transient diarrhea or shoulder discomfort.

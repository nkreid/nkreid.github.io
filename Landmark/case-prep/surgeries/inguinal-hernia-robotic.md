permalink: /landmark/case-prep/inguinal-hernia-robotic/
exam_focus: "Case Prep"
difficulty: "Intermediate"
time_goal: "Docking rehearsal"
attending_notes: "Uses rTAPP with self-fixating mesh and wants peritoneal closure with V-Loc."
patient_profile: "48-year-old with bilateral inguinal hernias, prior laparoscopic appendectomy."
high_yield_pearls:
  - "Center the camera port supraumbilically and dock from the patient's left to access both myopectineal orifices."
  - "Dissect a broad preperitoneal plane; expose Cooper's ligament medially and psoas laterally."
  - "Avoid energy directly on cord structures—use sharp dissection near vas and gonadal vessels."
workflow_steps:
  - "Place three 8 mm robotic ports across the upper abdomen and dock robot."
  - "Incise peritoneum 3–4 cm above the defect and raise a wide flap."
  - "Reduce indirect sac, lipoma, or direct defect and clear space of Bogros."
  - "Place large mesh overlapping Cooper's ligament, psoas, and inguinal ligament without folds."
  - "Close peritoneum to cover mesh completely and ensure no bowel entrapment."
preop_checklist:
  - "Review prior operative reports for mesh or preperitoneal scarring."
  - "Ensure balloon dissector backup available if needed."
  - "Verify urinary catheter placement for bladder decompression."
pimp_questions:
  - question: "What are the boundaries of the myopectineal orifice?"
    answer: "Laterally iliopsoas, medially rectus abdominis/Cooper's ligament, superiorly transversus abdominis arch, inferiorly pectineal ligament."
  - question: "How do you manage peritoneal tears during TAPP?"
    answer: "Patch small tears with absorbable suture or mesh; convert to TEP or open if plane lost."

    details: "Space of Retzius medial to inferior epigastrics; space of Bogros lateral toward anterior superior iliac spine."
  - title: "Triangle landmarks"
    details: "Triangle of doom bordered by vas and gonadal vessels; triangle of pain lateral to gonadal vessels."
attending_specific_comments:
  - "Requests 15 × 10 cm mesh per side with minimal fixation."
  - "Wants peritoneal closure started medially to avoid leaving pneumoperitoneum pockets."

## Basic Anatomy
- The myopectineal orifice houses direct, indirect, femoral, and obturator hernias; mesh must cover the entire region.
- Cooper's ligament lies on the superior pubic ramus; anchor mesh medially to this structure.
- Triangle of doom contains external iliac vessels; triangle of pain contains lateral femoral cutaneous nerve branches.

## Simplified Steps
1. Establish pneumoperitoneum, place robotic ports, and dock with arms angled toward the pelvis.
2. Incise peritoneum and develop preperitoneal plane medial to lateral, identifying Cooper's ligament and inferior epigastric vessels.
3. Reduce hernia sac and any cord lipomas, protecting vas deferens and gonadal vessels.
4. Place large mesh to cover direct, indirect, and femoral spaces with generous overlap; fixate sparingly if mesh is self-gripping.
5. Close peritoneal flap with running absorbable suture, evacuate preperitoneal CO₂, and undock.

## Postoperative Priorities
- Encourage early ambulation and deep breathing; manage urinary retention proactively.
- Limit heavy lifting for 2–3 weeks and educate about seroma expectations.
- Schedule clinic visit in 1–2 weeks to assess port sites and discuss activity progression.

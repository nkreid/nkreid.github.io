difficulty: "Advanced Core"
time_goal: "Night-before console rehearsal"
attending_notes: "Wants a supraumbilical camera for extra reach and early vessel sealing."
patient_profile: "32-year-old with perforated appendicitis converted to robotic platform after source control."
high_yield_pearls:
  - "Dock from the patient's left lower quadrant to maintain triangulation in the right iliac fossa."
  - "Use articulated instruments to sweep the terminal ileum away from the mesoappendix."
  - "Keep insufflation stable when using the robotic stapler to avoid cecal tenting."
workflow_steps:
  - "Position the patient in steep Trendelenburg with left tilt; dock robot from the left."
  - "Survey the abdomen, lyse adhesions, and expose the appendix."
  - "Dissect the mesoappendix with bipolar energy, clipping the appendiceal artery as needed."
  - "Divide the appendix with robotic stapler or loop and confirm hemostasis."
  - "Irrigate abscess cavities, place drain selectively, and undock."
preop_checklist:
  - "Ensure robotic stapler load and vessel sealer are available."
  - "Check that the assistant port allows suction/irrigation without external collisions."
  - "Review prior imaging for abscess location and drainable collections."
pimp_questions:
  - question: "How does port spacing change for robotic appendectomy versus laparoscopy?"
    answer: "Ports are spaced wider (8–10 cm) to prevent arm collision and allow instrument articulation around the cecum."
  - question: "When do you leave a drain after appendectomy?"
    answer: "Only with gross contamination, phlegmon, or inability to achieve full source control intraoperatively."

attending_specific_comments:

## Basic Anatomy
- The ileocolic artery gives rise to the appendiceal artery at the mesenteric border of the cecum.
- The appendix can be retrocecal, pelvic, subcecal, retroileal, or preileal; anticipate location during setup.
- Gerota's fascia and retroperitoneal structures are close when the appendix is retrocecal—stay anterior to avoid injury.

## Simplified Steps
1. Establish ports under direct vision and dock the robot with arms oriented toward the right lower quadrant.
2. Retract the appendix cephalad, open the mesoappendix, and seal the appendiceal artery under direct visualization.
3. Clear the appendiceal base circumferentially using bipolar and monopolar energy.
4. Transect the appendix with a robotic stapler or double loop; inspect for mucosal bleeding.
5. Irrigate, suction residual debris, and undock after confirming hemostasis and staple integrity.

## Postoperative Priorities
- Continue antibiotics based on source control status; escalate for ongoing sepsis or positive cultures.
- Encourage early ambulation and pulmonary toilet in Trendelenburg cases to reduce atelectasis.
- Monitor drain output if placed and arrange early clinic follow-up for removal.

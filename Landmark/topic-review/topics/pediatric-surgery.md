Trauma
 - #1 cause of death in children
 - What is the best indicator of shock in pediatric patients?
- Tachycardia
- Children look well until they decompensate quickly Tachycardia by age group (general rule of thumb): Neonate = > 150 beats per minute Age 1 - 6 = > 120 bpm Age 6 - 12 = > 110 bpm Age 13+ = same as adult
 - What are the targets for fluid resuscitation?
- Crystalloid = 20 mL/kg
- Blood = 10 mL/kg (give after 2 fluid boluses in hypotensive)
- UOP = 2-3 mL/kg/hr in neonate/infant, 1 mL/kg/hr in toddlers and older
- MIVF = 4 mL/kg/hr for 1st 10 kg → 2 for 2nd 10 → 1 for the rest
 - How do you choose ETT in children < 10 years old?
- Uncuffed tube for neonates only
- Size = , size of pinkie, or Breslow tape Emesis Important to know age group for most common presentations and bilious vs non-bilious
- What is the differential by age?
 - Neonates
- Nonsurgical: infectious, allergy, metabolic disorder
- Surgical: GERD, pyloric stenosis, intestinal obstruction, atresia

 - Infants/toddlers
- Nonsurgical: infectious, neurologic/psychologic, gastroparesis
- Surgical: intussusception
 - Adolescents
- Nonsurgical: functional disorder, IBD, psychologic
- Surgical: appendicitis
- What is the differential for non-bilious emesis?
 - Pyloric stenosis
- Buzz words: projectile vomiting, olive mass
- Metabolic disturbance: HYPOchloremic, HYPOkalemic, metabolic alkalosis + paradoxic aciduria
- Diagnosis = ultrasound → pylorus > 4 mm thick and > 14 mm long PIloric stenosis (pi = 3.14): > 3mm thick and > 14 mm long
- Treatment = RESUSCITATE first with normal saline → dextrose containing MIVF → OR for pyloromyotomy Do not resuscitate with lactated Ringer’s, which contains potassium, until metabolic disturbance is resolved.
 - What are the features of tracheoesophageal fistula?
- Five types
- Type C most common with blind ending esophageal atresia and distal TE fistula
- Type A is the next most common and is the only one without a TE fistula, just esophageal atresia
- Diagnosis = AXR (Type C will have gas + distended stomach vs Type A will be gasless)
- Important in diagnostic workup- check for VACTERL
- What are the VACTERL syndrome components?

 - Vertebral anomalies → sacral US
 - Anorectal- imperforate anus → rectal exam
- Presentation: meconium in urine or vagina from fistula if high or to perineal skin if low
- Treatment = above levators need colostomy first, below levators straight to posterior sagittal anoplasty + postop anal dilation
 - Cardiac → echocardiogram
 - TE fistula
 - Renal → US
 - Limb anomalies
- Treatment = resuscitate with Replogle tube (double-lumen tube to suction saliva and keep esophagus patent) → G-tube + primary repair (right extrapleural thoracotomy)
- Common complications: similar to esophagectomy → GERD, leak, stricture, fistula

Figure 1 - Types of trachea-esophageal fistulae
 - Intussusception (will be bilious if obstructed)
- Buzz words: currant jelly stools, target sign on imaging
- Underlying etiology: #1 inflamed Peyer’s patches after viral illness, #2 lymphoma, #3 Meckel’s diverticulum Intussusception in adults are commonly caused by a malignant lead point → OR, no air contrast enema

- Diagnosis = US
- Treatment = air-contrast enema
- What if it recurs?
 - 15% recur, repeat air-contrast enema
- When do you operate?
 - If unable to reduce with enema, peritonitis, obstruction After successful reduction with enema → observe for 4 hours, PO challenge, discharge
- What is the differential for bilious emesis?
 - Malrotation with midgut volvulus (malrotation on its own is asymptomatic)
- Malrotation etiology = failure of normal 270-degree rotation during intestinal development
- Volvulus caused by Ladd’s bands (adhesions from right retroperitoneum)
- If child with malrotation is going to develop volvulus, majority present by 1 year old
- Diagnosis = always #1 on differential in pediatric bilious emesis → emergent upper GI to rule it out (duodenum doesn’t cross midline)
- Associations: CDH in 20%, omphalocele
- Treatment = resect Ladd’s bands and counterclockwise detorsion to place small intestine on right and large intestine on left + appendectomy (to avoid future diagnostic uncertainty) Turn back time: counterclockwise detorsion
 - Duodenal atresia
- Buzz words: double-bubble sign on X-ray (image search this)

- #1 cause of duodenal obstruction in neonates
- What are some associations?
- Polyhydramnios (not swallowing the amniotic fluid)
- Cardiac, renal, GI anomalies
- Down’s syndrome in 20%
- Diagnosis = AXR + UGI
- Treatment = resuscitate → reconnect to duodenum or jejunum
- Other intestinal atresias are due to intrauterine vascular accidents - most commonly in jejunum and can be multiple Duodenal atresia is caused by failure of recanalization
 - Meconium ileus
- Presentation: no meconium passed in first 24 hours
- Diagnosis = AXR shows dilated small bowel without air- fluid level + sweat chloride test
- Association: 10% of cystic fibrosis patients
- Treatment = Gastrogafin enema or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) enema
- When should you operate?
 - Perforation, ostomy creation for antegrade NAC enemas
- What’s another disease that doesn’t pass meconium in first 24 hours?
- Hirschsprung’s disease
 - #1 cause of colonic obstruction in infants, 2-3 years old will have chronic constipation
 - Presentation: distention +/- colitis
 - Diagnosis = suction rectal biopsy → absent ganglion cells in myenteric plexus (due to failure to progress caudad)

 - Treatment = resect rectum and colon until ganglion cells present → can reconnect colon to anus later
- If colitis (foul smelling diarrhea, sepsis) → rectal irrigation +/- emergency colectomy Bloody stools
 - Intussusception - remember currant jelly stools
 - How does necrotizing enterocolitis present?
- Bloody stools after 1st feeding, premature baby, abdominal distension, septic
- Diagnosis = AXR → pneumatosis (not an indication for surgery alone), free air, portal venous gas (portends poor prognosis) + serial lateral decubitus films to monitor for perforation
- Treatment = resuscitate, NPO, Abx, TPN, orogastric tube
- When to operate?
 - Pneumoperitoneum, peritonitis, clinical deterioration, abdominal wall erythema
- Barium enema prior to taking down ostomies down the road to rule out stenotic distal obstruction
 - What is a Meckel’s diverticulum?
- Due to persistent vitelline (omphalomesenteric) duct
- Presentation: painless lower GI bleed most commonly
- What is the rule of 2s?
- 2 inches long
- 2 cm diameter
- < 2 years old
- 2:1 male to female predominance
- 2 feet from ileocecal valve
- 2% of the population
- 2% symptomatic
- 2 types of tissue- pancreatic and gastric

 - Gastric most likely to be symptomatic
- 2 presentations - diverticulitis and bleeding
- Diagnosis = Meckel’s scan for operative preparation (will only pick up gastric mucosa)
- Treatment = resection of diverticulum + segmental resection if involving base or >1/3 size of bowel or diverticulitis Abdominal Wall Defects Table 1 - Features of gastroschisis versus omphalocele
 - in omphalocele: looks like a complete sac (covered by peritoneum), looks like a belly button (midline)
 - When do you repair a pediatric umbilical hernia?
- If it hasn’t closed by 5 years of age
 - What is the etiology of inguinal hernias?
- Due to persistent processus vaginalis
- Treatment = elective high ligation of sac, OR within 72 hours of reduction if incarcerated
- Explore contralateral side if left-sided, female, or < 1 year old In adults, hernias are typically repaired with resection of the hernia sac.

- Hydrocele similar but no sac extending into internal ring
- Communicating vs noncommunicating
 - Noncommunicating usually resolve by 1 year
 - Communicating wax and wane
- Treatment = surgery at 1 year old if not resolved or communicating → resect hydrocele and ligate processus vaginalis
 - What are the features of undescended testicles?
- Associations: risk of testicular CA even after orchiopexy, seminoma, chromosomal disorder if undescended bilaterally
- Treatment = orchiopexy (can divide spermatic vessels because of vas deferens collateral) Abdominal Masses
 - How do neuroblastomas present?
- Usually asymptomatic, can have HTN, diarrhea, raccoon eyes from orbital metastases, or unsteady gait
- Most commonly adrenal, but can be anywhere along sympathetic chain
- Most commonly < 2 years old with best prognosis if < 1 year old
- Rarely metastasizes
- Diagnosis = catecholamines, metanephrines VMA, HVA, AXR showing stippled calcifications, CT showing renal displacement (vs Wilms replaces parenchyma)
- High risk/worse prognosis: neuron-specific enolase, LDH, HVA, diploid tumor, N-myc amplification Similar to pheochromocytoma
- Treatment = resection, can try neoadjuvant doxorubicin if unresectable

 - What is a nephroblastoma (Wilms tumor)?
- Presentation: asymptomatic, hematuria, HTN, 10% are bilateral, average age 3 years old
- Metastasizes to bone and lung (requires radiation)
- Diagnosis = abdominal CT with replacement of renal parenchyma
- WAGR = Wilms + aniridia + GU malformation + mental retardation
- Treatment = nephrectomy without rupturing (will upstage) + actinomycin and vincristine chemo
 - What are the features of a hepatoblastoma?
- Elevated AFP
- Treatment = resection, chemotherapy if unresectable Hepatobiliary
 - Choledochal cyst [See Hepatobiliary chapter]
- Thought to be caused by reflux of pancreatic enzymes in utero
- 5 types- most common is Type I fusiform dilation of CBD
- Treatment = resection, some require hepaticojejunostomy or liver TXP

Figure 2 - Types of choledochal cysts
 - What is biliary atresia?
- Most common indication for pediatric liver transplant
- Presentation: persistent neonatal jaundice
- Diagnosis = liver biopsy → periportal fibrosis, bile plug; US, cholangiography
- Treatment = Kasai (hepaticoportojejunostomy) is first step

if < 3 months of age → transplant
- 1/3 improve, 1/3 progress to transplant, 1/3 die Thoracic
 - What are the types of congenital lung disease?
- Pulmonary sequestration
- Lung tissue that doesn’t communicate with tracheobronchial tree with independent blood supply from aorta
- Venous drainage can be systemic (extra-lobar) or pulmonary (intra-lobar)
- Presentation: infection, abnormal CXR
- Treatment = ligate arterial supply → lobectomy
- Congenital cystic adenoid malformation
- Communicates with tracheobronchial tree (vs pulmonary sequestration)
- Treatment = lobectomy
- Congenital lobar emphysema
- Failure of cartilage development
- Presentation: similar to tension PTX
- Treatment = lobectomy Do not place a chest tube in congenital lobar emphysema.

- Bronchogenic cyst
- Extrapulmonary cysts of bronchial tissue and cartilage
- Presentation: mediastinal cystic mass
- Treatment = resect
 - What are the features of congenital diaphragmatic hernia?
- Two types:
- Bochdalek = most common, posterior
- Morgagni = rare, anterior

Bochdalek is back and to the left
- Most commonly left sided because the liver protects the right; usually both lungs are dysfunctional
- Associations: severe pulmonary HTN, cardiac and neural tube defects, malrotation
- Diagnosis = prenatal US, CXR will show bowel in chest
- Treatment = ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide, ECMO; stabilize → OR to run the bowel and repair defect Neck
 - Where do branchial cleft cysts present?
- Most commonly 2nd branchial cleft cysts which are on the middle of the anterior SCM
- Treatment for all 3 branchial cleft cysts = resection
 - How do thyroglossal duct cysts present?
- Midline (vs branchial cleft), goes through hyoid bone
- Formed from abnormal descent of thyroid gland and may be patient’s only thyroid tissue
- Treatment = Sistrunk procedure → excision of cyst, tract, and hyoid bone to base of tongue
 - What is a cystic hygroma?
- Lymphangioma, lymphatic malformation connecting to IJ
- Presentation: Lateral neck in posterior triangle, soft, cystic, multi-loculated; gets infected
- Treatment = resection

Figure 3 - Common cystic lesions of the neck Quick Hits
- Which immunoglobulin crosses the placenta?
 - IgG
- Which immunoglobulin is transferred through breast milk?
 - IgA
- 1 month old with elevated AFP and beta-HCG . Diagnosis?
 - Sacrococcygeal teratoma - usually malignant after 2 months old
- Most common anterior mediastinal mass = teratoma
 - Most common overall mediastinal mass = neurogenic tumor (posterior mediastinum)
- 6-month-old with red lesions growing on face and scalp . Diagnosis and treatment?
 - Hemangioma will resolve by 8 years old, otherwise steroids or laser

- 13-year-old boy with large sunken area of chest?
 - Pectus excavatum → treat with strut if symptomatic
 - Pectus carinatum = pigeon chest, doesn’t need correction (chest brace) unless emotional distress

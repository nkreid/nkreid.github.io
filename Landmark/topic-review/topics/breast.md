High Yield Anatomy
- What are the surgical boundaries of the axillary lymph nodes?
 - Level I - Lateral to pec minor
 - Level II - Posterior to pec minor
 - Level III - Medial to pec minor Figure 1. Surgical Levels of The Axillary Lymph Nodes
- Name the nerve that can be injured during an axillary dissection based on the clinical sequela
 - Results in winged scapula:
- Long thoracic innervating the serratus anterior
 - Results in weakness in pullups and arm adduction:
- Thoracodorsal nerve innervating the latissimus dorsi

 - This nerve results in sensory deficits to the medial arm:
- Intercostobrachial
- What nerve innervates both pec major and pec minor:
 - Medial pectoral nerve
 - Lateral pectoral nerve only innervates pec major Lateral pectoral nerve only innervates pec major

- What is the blood supply to the breast?
 - Internal thoracic (aka mammary)
 - Intercostals
 - Lateral thoracic
 - Thoracoacromial arteries
- What is Batson’s plexus?
 - Valveless venous plexus that allows direct hematogenous spread to the spine Benign Breast Disease
- Breast Pain
 - Common, self-limited in most cases
 - Most frequent during the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle
 - Treatment
- Reassurance
- For severe pain, the following have been studied with variable results:
- danazol, bromocriptine, tamoxifen, primrose oil, vitamin E
- What is Mondor’s disease and what is the treatment?
 - Superficial thrombophlebitis of the lateral thoracic vein or a tributary

- MC secondary to recent surgery, trauma, or other inflammatory process
- Rarely associated with carcinoma
 - Presentation: tender, palpable subcutaneous cord
 - Treatment: NSAIDs
- Fibrocystic disease
 - Most common in perimenopausal women
 - Symptoms: breast pain, nipple discharge, lumps that vary throughout menstrual cycle
 - Treatment:
- Simple cysts → observe
- Symptomatic → aspirate
- If aspirate is bloody or recurrent → cytology
- Bloody aspirate → surgical excision
- Unresolved after aspiration → surgical excision
- Recurrence → surgical excision
 - Is there a risk of cancer?
- If cytology demonstrates atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia
- Fibroadenoma and Phyllodes tumors
 - Presentation: dominant mass
 - Dx:
- Imaging
- If <35 yo → ultrasound (density of breast tissue)
- If >35 yo → mammography
- If findings are consistent with a benign fibroadenoma AND no risk factors → bi-annual ultrasound
- If any uncertainty → core needle biopsy (CNB)
- What if the mass continues to enlarge?
- Need excisional biopsy
 - Fibroadenoma variants

- Giant fibroadenoma
- >6 cm, can be difficult to distinguish from phyllodes tumor
- Complex fibroadenoma = risk for developing carcinoma
- Fibroadenoma with sclerosing adenosis, papillary apocrine hyperplasia, cysts, or epithelial calcifications
- Tubular adenoma = benign
- Variant of peri canalicular fibroadenoma with adenosis- like epithelial proliferation
 - Phyllodes tumor
- Subclassifications: benign, borderline, malignant
- 10% become malignant (greater potential if >5 mitoses per high power field)
 - Rare hematogenous metastasis (does not go to nodes, so no sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLN) or Axillary dissection)
- Treatment: Wide local excision (1 cm margins)
- Do you need to perform SLN or axillary dissection?
 - No . Hematogenous metastasis (rare)
- Nipple discharge
 - What is the MC cause of bloody nipple discharge?
- Intraductal papilloma (not premalignant)
 - What findings are more concerning for malignancy?
- Bloody, spontaneous, persistent, unilateral
- <40 yo → 3% associated with cancer
- >60 yo → 32% associated with malignancy
 - Diagnosis:
- Ductal fluid cytology, contrast ductogram, ductoscopy - minimally helpful
- Best diagnostic test = Duct excision
 - Treatment: subareolar resection of involved duct and papilloma

- Duct Ectasia
 - Dilation of the subareolar duct in peri- and post- menopausal women
 - Symptoms: cheesy, viscous nipple discharge
 - Treatment:
- Asymptomatic → observe
- Symptomatic → duct excision
- Breast Infections
 - What are the most common bacteria to cause both breast abscesses and mastitis?
- Staphylococcus aureus
 - 2 groups:
- Lactational - Most likely from blockage of the lactiferous ducts
- If no abscess → antibiotics alone, continue breastfeeding
- If abscess → aspiration and antibiotics, continue breastfeeding
 - I&D if does not resolve promptly
- AE = concern for development of milk fistula
- Nonlactational - Periductal infections associated with smoking and ductal ectasia
- Tx: antibiotics, I&D if abscess present
 - Patient presents with recurrent, unresolving mastitis . What else do you need to do?
- Biopsy of the skin to rule out inflammatory breast cancer
- Sclerosing Adenosis
 - Presentation: microcalcifications
 - Diagnosis: core needle biopsy
 - Treatment: if no atypia and concordant with imaging → observe

 - Not a precursor to cancer
- Radial Scar
 - Alternate names: sclerosing papillary proliferations, benign sclerosing ductal proliferation
 - Diagnosis: mammogram - appears similar to small, invasive cancer
 - Treatment: excisional biopsy
- Associated with a small increased risk of cancer and the difference between invasive breast carcinoma may be difficult to determine on core biopsy alone High Risk Breast Lesions
- Atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH)
 - Less well developed but morphologically similar to LCIS
 - Not pre-malignant, but marker of increased risk
- 8-12-fold greater lifetime risk, or ~1% per year
 - Diagnosis: CNB
 - Treatment: excisional biopsy
- Why excise if not pre-malignant?
- Discordant finding as these lesions are often incidental to the radiographic abnormality that prompted the biopsy
- Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH)
 - Associated with a 4-5-fold increased risk of invasive cancer
 - Diagnosis: CNB
 - Treatment: Excisional biopsy
- 9-30% incidence of DCIS on excisional biopsy
- 3% chance of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)

 - Multifocal and bilateral, genetic predisposition
 - 90% ER/PR+ and HER2-
 - What is the malignancy risk?
- Marker for 40% risk of CA development in EITHER breast
 - What type of cancer do they develop?
- Ductal carcinoma
 - Treatment:
- Wire localized excision
- What if there is a positive margin?
- No re-excision, adjuvant hormonal therapy
 - Pleomorphic LCIS = variant that is treated like DCIS No re-excision needed for LCIS when margin comes back positive
- Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
 - Malignant cells of the ductal epithelium without invasion of the basement membrane (premalignant lesion)
 - What is the malignancy risk?
- 50% in ipsilateral breast
- 5% in contralateral breast
 - Presentation: majority are non-palpable
 - Diagnosis: Mammography, CNB
 - Treatment:
- Breast conserving therapy (BCT) = lumpectomy (1 cm margins) with adjuvant radiation (XRT)
- Post op whole breast XRT reduces risk of local recurrence by 50% but does not affect overall survival
- Large, multiquadrant, or contraindication to BCT → simple mastectomy + SLN

- Up to 25% DCIS may show invasive component on final pathology, so SLN sampling required before removing all breast tissue
- Skin and nipple-sparing procedures with immediate reconstruction are options
- Adjuvant therapy
- Premenopausal → tamoxifen
- Postmenopausal → aromatase inhibitor (anastrazole)
 - What is the most aggressive subtype of DCIS?
- Comedo
- Characterized by necrosis
- Treatment: simple mastectomy + adjuvant hormone therapy DCIS excision need 2mm margin Breast Cancer
- Screening
 - When should you start screening mammography?
- Low risk: Age 40 every 2-3 years → annually after age 50
- High risk: 10 years before youngest age of diagnosis in first-degree relative
- Hereditary disorders with increased risk: BRCA 1/2, Li-Fraumeni (p53), Cowden syndrome (PTEN), Peutz- Jeghers (STK11), CDH1
 - BRCA 1/2 mutations → 10-20-fold increased risk → 30-60% risk by age 60
 - Screening age 25 with annual mammogram AND MRI + pelvic exam and CA-125
 - Findings on mammography that are concerning for malignancy: irregular borders, spiculated, distortion of breast, or small/thin linear branching calcification
 - BIRADS classification

Ventilator Settings and Management
- Most physiologic ventilator mode?
 - Iron lung (Negative Pressure Ventilation)
- Ventilator induced lung injury
 - Volume
 - Pressure (Barotrauma)
 - Oxygen Toxicity
- Oxygenation vs Ventilation
 - Oxygenation affected by:
 - Fi02, PEEP, Mean Airway Pressure
 - Ventilation affected by:
 - RR, Tidal Volume
 - RR x TV = Minute Ventilation
- Peak pressure - reflects pressure in large airways
- Plateau pressure - must do inspiratory pause . This allows pressures to equilibrate and better reflects alveolar pressure
- What if there is large differential between peak and plateau pressure (e .g . Peak 50, Plateau 30)?
 - Large airway obstruction
 - Bronchospasm
- What if peak and plateau are both high?
 - Alveolar lung disease (e .g . ARDS)
- Negative inspiratory Force (NIF) - Must do expiratory pause to check this .
- Vent Modes
 - Continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV)/Assist Control (AC)
- Respiratory Rate (RR) and Volume are set
- Every breath is fully supported
- Problems: Volume is set regardless of pressure and can result in barotrauma; hyperventilation if patient RR is high .

 - Pressure Support (PS)
- Pressure is set
- Advantages: Limits barotrauma
- Disadvantages: Hypoventilation
 - Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilations (SIMV)
- RR and Volume set
- Spontaneous breaths above set rate are not fully supported
- Delivered breaths are synchronized - typically a more comfortable mode of breathing
- Problems: Patients can tire out
 - Extubation criteria
 - Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT) should be done every day
 - Follows commands (i .e . neurologically able to protect airway)
 - Minimal Vent Settings for extubation (in general):
- Fi02 50% or less
- PEEP <10
- Rapid shallow RR/TV < 100 (Best Predictor)
- NIF > 20 (Good predictor of who will fail if <20; However >20 is poorly predictive of who will do well) Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
- Definition: Within 1 week of insult, characteristic radiographic finding, not cardiogenic
 - Mild: P:F ratio = 200-300
 - Moderate: P:F ratio = 100-200
 - Severe: P:F ratio = <100
- Ventilator strategies for ARDS
 - Lung protection ARDSNET protocol - Low tidal volume (4- 6cc/kg)

 - Permissive hypercapnia
- Generally, as long as pH above 7 .20 it is recommended to allow hypercapnia as long as the patient is oxygenating . This avoids further lung injury .
 - Strategies for ARDS patients that are failing
- Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV)
- Long inhalation period with short extubation
- Set P-high (Pressure High) and P-Low (Pressure Low) as well as T-high (Time High) and T-Low (Time Low)
 - Want long T-high and short T-low
- Patient can breathe spontaneously throughout
- Proning
- Nitrous Oxide, NM blockade
- Proning and neuromuscular blockade have proven benefits for ARDS in prospective RCTs Sepsis
- Old definition - Focused on inflammation (SIRS Criteria)
 - Sepsis = SIRS + infection source
 - Severe Sepsis = SIRS + source + end organ dysfunction
 - Septic Shock = SIRS + end organ dysfunction + hypotension/pressor requirement
 - New Definition - Focuses more on organ dysfunction with infection (SOFA Score)
 - SOFA = Sequential Organ Function Assessment
 - Sepsis = If SOFA score increases by 2 or more points, or a score of 2 or more on a patient initial presentation
 - Septic Shock = Pressor requirement AND lactate of 2 or more despite resuscitation
- Diagnostic adjuncts
 - Procalcitonin - when normalizes can be a guide to stop antibiotics

- Better at ruling out sepsis if negative; More sensitive than specific
 - 1,3 beta-d-glucan assay for fungal infections
 - Mannan antigen and anti-mannan antibody for invasive candidiasis
- Sepsis management
 - Send cultures before starting antibiotics
 - Within 3 hours → Start antibiotic (send cultures prior), bolus with 30cc/kg crystalloid if lactate >4
 - Within 6 hours → Start pressors (norepinephrine recommended over dopamine, vasopressin added as secondary) if needed to maintain MAP, repeat lactate
 - Activated protein C is no longer recommended (Never choose as an answer)
 - Adrenal insufficiency in Septic Shock?
- Generally do not do a stimulation test - if refractory shock and suspect adrenal insufficiency, you should empirically treat with hydrocortisone
 - Glucose control in the ICU
- Tight glucose control is associated with worse outcomes; shoot for <180 Vasoactive agents
- Dopamine
 - Receptors:
- Low dose: Dopamine receptors in kidney
- Medium dose: Beta 1
- High dose: Alpha

- Most common EKG findings with PE?
 - Sinus tachycardia
 - Classic S1Q3T3 finding is uncommon
- Diagnosis

 - CT Pulmonary Arteriogram is study of choice
 - Role of D-Dimer?
- Sensitive -- Good for ruling out PE . High false positive rate .

 - Indications for thrombolytics with PE?
- Hemodynamic instability
- Right heart strain on echocardiogram
 - Pulmonary embolectomy (Trendelenburg Procedure)
- Uncommon
- Surgical option if there is a contraindication for lytics Cardiovascular physiology
- Central Venous Pressure (CVP) - surrogate for end diastolic right ventricular volume
- Pulmonary Wedge Pressure (PWP) - surrogate for end diastolic left ventricular volume
- Cardiac Output (CO)= Stroke volume x Heart Rate
- Cardiac index (CI)= Cardiac Output/Body Surface Area
- Swan Ganz Patterns - Less commonly used but good to know principles
 - Hemorrhagic shock
 - Low CO, High Systemic vascular resistance (SVR), Low filling pressures (CVP/PWP)
 - Septic shock
- High CO (may be low in late septic shock), Low SVR, Low/ Normal filling pressures (CVP, PWP)
 - Cardiogenic shock
- Low CO, High SVR, High filling pressures (CVP, PWP)

- Formulas you need to know
 - Oxygen Delivery = CO x [Hb x 02 Saturation x 1 .34 + (Pa02 x 0 .003)]
 - Oxygen Consumption = CO x (Arterial-Venous 02 difference)
 - Extraction Ratio = O2 Consumption/O2 Delivery
- What decreases the Extraction Ratio?
- Sepsis, cardiac failure, anemia/hypoxia, fever, seizure can affect extraction ratios Anticoagulation Agents and reversal
- Coumadin - Inhibits Vit K dependent factors
 - Reversal:
- FFP, Vit K
- If emergent reversal needed → PCC
- Less volume than FFP
- Reversal is faster and more predictable than FFP
- Dabigatran (Pradaxa) - Direct Thrombin inhibitors
 - Reversal:
- Dialysis
- Praxbind - New monoclonal antibody against Pradaxa
- Apixaban (Eliquis), Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) - Factor Xa inhibitors
 - Reversal:
- PCC will give partial reversal Nutrition
- Metabolic Cart (Indirect Calorimetry)
 - Measures 02 Consumption and C02 production
 - Respiratory Quotient (RQ) = C02 production/02 consumption
 - RQ is useful to identify carbohydrate overfeeding in intubated patients, which results in higher C02 production and difficulty weaning from the ventilator.

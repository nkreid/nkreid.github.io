Carotid/Vertebral
- What are the structures of the carotid sheath?
 - Carotid Artery
 - Internal Jugular Vein
 - Vagus Nerve
- What are the segments of the vertebral artery?
 - V1 - Origin off subclavian to foramina of C6
 - V2 (Foraminal) - From the transverse foramen of C2-C6
 - V3 - From C2 to Dura
 - V4 - Intracranial
- What is the structure commonly overlies the carotid artery bifurcation?
 - Facial vein off of IJ generally overlies the bifurcation
- What is the first branch of the external carotid artery?
 - Superior thyroid artery
- Is the external carotid artery flow high or low resistance ?
 - It is high resistance (flows to muscular facial muscles), so triphasic flow on doppler, brief reversal of flow
- Can the external carotid artery be ligated?
 - External carotid can be tied off to help control excessive facial bleeding in trauma
- Internal carotid artery main blood supply to brain, first branch is the ophthalmic
 - Low resistance as it is supplying brain tissue, so it has continuous forward flow which creates a biphasic doppler signal Doppler of the internal carotid is biphasic with a long diastolic phase, distinctly different than the high resistance of the triphasic external carotid

Figure 1. Carotid Bifurcation Anatomy
- Hoarseness after carotid endarterectomy?
 - Likely injury to vagus nerve
 - From clamping the carotid the vagus nerve was also clamped
- Tongue deviation to side of injury?
 - Likely hypoglossal nerve injury
 - Nerve lies just cephalad to carotid bifurcation so can easily be damaged
- Ipsilateral mouth droop after a carotid?
 - Marginal mandibular injury
 - From retraction on mandible, generally when trying to expose high lesions
- This nerve lies deep to posterior belly of digastric and if divided can cause disabling dysphagia .
 - Glossopharyngeal

- What layers of carotid are removed during an endarterectomy?
 - Intima and part of the media
- What is the typical location of carotid atherosclerosis?
 - Carotid bifurcation due to turbulence
- Indications for performing carotid endarterectomy
 - Symptomatic (stroke or TIA), 50-70% warrants surgery
 - Asymptomatic - controversial if over 80% or EDV (end diastolic velocity) > 140 cm/s (which correlates with 80% stenosis)
- Should start with medical management aspirin and a statin
- What if patient is symptomatic but duplex shows <50% stenosis?
 - No surgery indicated
 - Optimize medical management - aspirin, Plavix and a statin
- What if patient has a stroke and imaging shows a completely occluded carotid artery?
 - Anticoagulation to prevent progression, no benefit to recanalizing
- What situations would an emergent carotid endarterectomy be indicated
 - Crescendo TIAs
- TIA symptoms are recurring and becoming more severe or lasting longer in duration
- What is the most common non stroke cause of morbidity and mortality after CEA
 - Myocardial infarction
- When should you operate on a symptomatic carotid
 - Small stroke or TIA - within two weeks once symptoms resolve
 - Hemorrhagic stroke - 6-8 weeks

- What if patient demonstrates symptoms of stroke in PACU after carotid endarterectomy
 - Return to OR to evaluate for intimal flaps or thrombus
 - In OR start with US
- Which clinical scenarios would you consider carotid stenting over carotid endarterectomy
 - Hx of neck dissection, neck irradiation, recurrent carotid disease
 - Severe cardiac disease TCAR (Transcarotid Artery Revascularization) or transfemoral stenting should be considered in patients with previous neck surgery or radiation. TCAR has lowest stroke rate. Non-Atherosclerotic Carotid Lesions
- A patient s/p blunt trauma and is found to have asymptomatic carotid dissection
 - Should be anticoagulated (either heparin or Plavix, not standardized)
 - Repeat imaging before leaving hospital
- A patient s/p blunt trauma and found to have a symptomatic dissection
 - Will likely require a covered stent
- A patient s/p blunt trauma with traumatic occlusion of carotid artery
 - If already have neurologic injury/completed stroke unlikely to get better with intervention

 - Subclavian Vein Thrombosis (Paget-Schroetter), compression at costoclavicular junction
 - Treat with catheter directed thrombolysis followed by first rib resection within the same hospital stay or shortly after
- A young person with no atherosclerotic risks factors presents with ischemia of the hand
 - Common presentation for arterial TOS, though arterial TOS is very rare
 - Likely an anomalous cervical rib is compressing the subclavian artery and will lead to an aneurysm, which is an embolic risk
 - Will need first rib resection with interposition graft for the artery Subclavian Steal Syndrome
- Where is the anatomic stenosis that results in subclavian steal?
 - Proximal subclavian narrowing
 - Results in a reversal of blood flow in vertebral, which can lead to vertebrobasilar symptoms

- How long should a temporary catheter be left in place (called Vas-Cath at many places) and why do they need to be removed?
 - 3 weeks
 - Infection risk
- How do long term tunneled catheters differ (Permacath)
 - They are cuffed
 - They are tunneled
 - Lower risk of central infection
 - Still higher infection rate, and high risk of central venous stenosis compared with fistula or graft
- What is preferred location for temporary dialysis access and what should be taken into account?
 - Right IJ direct to right atrium
 - Avoid the side where you plan to place permanent AV Fistula
 - Will cause central venous stenosis, will lead to failure of permanent access
- What is preferred location for AV fistula creation for dialysis access?
 - “Fistula First” Always start distal on non-dominant arm, and upper extremities before lower extremities, Start distal to not burn bridges .
 - Reducing catheter days, improves life expectancy
 - Focus is now moving to choosing the right access for the right person, a person with a short life expectancy, a fistula may not be the best access

- What is the most common reason for AV fistulas to malfunction over time?
 - The major cause of hemodialysis AV access failure is venous outflow problems.
- A patient reports that she is having high venous return pressures, and increased bleeding after dialysis, what is the likely problem, how do you diagnose it and what is the treatment?
 - Likely has venous outflow stenosis
 - Can be diagnosed with duplex US
 - Fistulogram with balloon angioplasty can likely correct the lesion
- What are criteria for fistula maturation, “Rule of 6s”?
 - Needs to be 6 mm in diameter
 - <6 mm deep
 - >600 mL/min in flow
- 6 weeks after a brachio-cephalic fistula creation, the fistula fails to mature, what are some likely causes of this and how can they be managed?
 - Possible inadequate inflow, rule out stricture at anastomosis, potential balloon angioplasty vs revision of anastomosis
 - Competing flow from side branches, branches need to be ligated or coiled A bleeding fistula with pinpoint hole bleeding can be treated with a stitch and urgent fistulogram. Bleeding from an ulcer on a fistula is a surgical emergency.

- What nerve can you injure with the lateral incision and what deficit would you see?
 - Superficial peroneal nerve which can lead to difficulties with foot eversion .
- To access superficial posterior and deep posterior compartments?
 - Make incision two centimeters posterior/medial to tibia
 - The key to perform a complete four-compartment fasciotomy is to make sure that the posterior deep compartment has been fully decompressed. Both the superficial and the deep posterior compartments are decompressed through the medial incision .
- How do you release the deep posterior compartment?
 - Take soleus off of the tibia . Thoracic Aorta
- In a blunt thoracic aortic injury, where is the most common site of injury?

 - Pts with thrombotic AMI, likely have had unrecognized symptoms for months - years
 - These patients will likely require a mesenteric bypass rather than embolectomy
- Which disease process embolic vs thrombotic will have proximal jejunal sparing?
 - Embolic because it lodges just distal to first branch of SMA (3-10 cm distal to ostium)
 - Thrombotic patients will not have any sparing of small intestine
- How do you identify the SMA to perform embolectomy?
 - Lift transverse colon cephalad and follow to base of transverse mesocolon
 - Just to the right of Ligament of Treitz (LOT) will be the SMA
 - Mobilize LOT to access SMA at its origin
- What are characteristics of mesenteric venous thrombosis

- Which part of large intestine is spared from ischemia after AAA induced colonic ischemia
 - Middle and distal rectum as they have separate blood supply from sigmoid/upper rectum

 - Blood supply is from internal iliacs not IMA

- When you perform an aorto-bifemoral bypass how do you decide between end to end aortic anastomosis vs end to side anastomosis?
 - Need to ensure flow into at least 1 internal iliac for pelvic perfusion
 - If external iliacs are patent can perform end-end as patient will have internal iliac perfusion from retrograde flow
 - If external iliacs are not patent can perform end-side anastomosis which will allow antegrade flow into internal iliacs assuming common iliacs are patent

- These must be fixed, as risk of rupture
- Generally place a cuff to seal more proximally or distally

 - Type II
- Lumbars or IMA continue to fill aneurysm sac
- Only need to be fixed if aneurysm sac continues to grow
- Coil embolization of lumbars feeding sac is best treatment option
 - Type III
- Components of the endograft are not sealed
- Must be fixed, as aneurysm sac will be pressurized
- Reinforce with cuff across previous interlap between components
 - Type IV
- Porosity of graft, or a tear in the graft
- May need to reline the graft with new endograft Peripheral Vascular Disease
- How do you calculate an ABI?
 - Take which ever pedal pressure is the highest (DP or PT) and divide that by the highest brachial pulse (right or left arm)
- How to interpret an ABI?
 - .9 → 1 .4 is normal

.5 → .89 may have claudication

<0 .5 = May have rest pain

<0 .3 = Tissue loss
- What if patient has non compressible vessels, can you rely on ABIs?
 - No small vessel calcification will lead to falsely elevated ABIs
 - Toes pressures should be obtained, as these vessels are generally free from calcification

- A patient presents with claudication, how do you treat them?
 - Smoking cessation, exercise, statin therapy
- What indications would you intervene on a patient with claudication
 - Lifestyle limiting claudication that failed improvement with medical management
 - Tissue loss
 - Rest pain High yield! Do not offer operation for claudication, unless failed medical management and severe lifestyle impairment
- What options are there for imaging blood vessels
 - CTA is good for proximal vessels to level of knee if kidney function ok
 - If not angiography can use less contrast and visualize tibial vessels better

 - MRA is also an option
- What are essentials of operative planning in vascular surgery?
 - Inflow, outflow and vascular conduit (if bypass)
- What are principles of deciding between treating a lesion endovascular vs open
 - In general, endovascular interventions are best suited for lesions that are short and not heavily calcified.
 - Long occlusions that are densely calcified with good inflow, outflow and conduit are likely better treated with open bypass vs endarterectomy .
 - The common femoral artery is rarely treated with an endovascular approach because it is a mobile area that is prone to kinking and also because of the relative ease of an open approach .

- A patient presents with buttock claudication, impotence, and absence of femoral pulses, what is this syndrome called and where would you expect the lesions to be?
 - Leriche Syndrome
 - Aorto-iliac symptoms
 - Patient likely needs an aorto-bifemoral bypass
- If a patient presents with a large acute embolus that lodges at the aortic bifurcation, how does this differ in regards to treatment options compared to Leriche Syndrome?

- In any patient with a foot wound it is important to make sure adequate perfusion, how is this done
 - Start with non invasive flow studies (NIFs) and ABIs
 - If these show flow that is impaired the patient needs an angiogram that can be both diagnostic and therapeutic Venous Disease
- How do operatively approach the left common iliac vein
 - By dividing the overlying right iliac artery, if the vein needs to be accessed and repaired
- What veins can be ligated in trauma
 - Can ligate any vein distal to renal veins
 - The closer to the renal veins the more morbidity, but if it is for exsanguinating hemorrhage it can be considered
 - If major vein ligation consider prophylactic fasciotomy
- Can you divide either renal vein?
 - You can divide the left renal vein if it is proximal to gonadal vein and gonadal vein is intact to allow retrograde drainage

DVT Management
- A pt has a swollen blue leg up to the buttocks, with motor and sensation intact, what are you worried about and what is the treatment?
 - Ileofemoral DVT causing phlegmasia cerulea dolens

High Yield Anatomy and Physiology
- What is the relationship of the parathyroid glands and the recurrent laryngeal nerve?
 - Superior parathyroids are posterior and lateral to RLN
- Originate from 4th pharyngeal pouch
 - Inferior parathyroids are anterior and medial to RLN
- Originate from 3rd pharyngeal pouch
- Inferior glands more variable
- Thymus also migrates with 3rd pharyngeal pouch
 - Inferior thyroid artery provides blood supply to all 4 glands in 80% of cases
- What cells release parathyroid hormone (PTH), and what is the stimulus?
 - PTH released from chief cells in parathyroid in response to low Ca levels
- What cells release calcitonin and what is the stimulus?
 - Calcitonin is released from parafollicular c-cells in the thyroid in response to high calcium
- What are the actions of PTH on bone and in the kidney?
 - Bone -- Stimulates osteoclasts for resorption of Ca and phosphate
 - Kidneys - Stimulates resorption of Ca, inhibits resorption of phosphate and bicarb, Stimulates conversion of 25(OH)D3 to 1,25(OH)2D3 via 1-alpha hydroxylase (phosphate trashing hormone)
- How does Vit D (1,25OH2D3) increase serum Ca?
 - Stimulates absorption of Ca and Phosphate in gut
- How does Calcitonin decrease serum Ca in the bone and the kidney?
 - Bone -- Inhibits osteoclast bone resorption
 - Kidney - Inhibits resorption of Ca and phosphate

Figure 1: Parathyroid Hormone Physiology
- What is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in the outpatient and inpatient setting?
 - Outpatient = primary hyperparathyroidism
 - Inpatient = Malignancy
- What is the mechanism of hypercalcemia due to malignancy?
 - MCC hypercalcemia 2/2 malignancy is production of PTH related protein (e.g. Squamous cell lung CA, Breast CA)
 - Lytic bone lesions are less common malignant cause of hypercalcemia
- What is the treatment of a hypercalcemic crisis?
 - Treat with fluids (normal saline around 300ml/hr) and lasix once patient is euvolemic . Initially just saline . Why not LR?
 - LR has calcium
- What . are the most common causes of primary

hyperparathyroidism?
 - Adenoma (80-90%; 2-5% have double adenoma)
 - Hyperplasia (10-15%)
 - Parathyroid CA (<1%), MEN 1 and 2A
- What are the laboratory tests used to diagnose hyperparathyroidism?
 - Increased Ca (24-hour collection), Decreased Phos (except with renal failure)
 - Elevated serum PTH (normal 5-40 pg/dL)
 - Chloride to Phosphate ratio >33 (Very specific)
 - Increased Urinary Ca, Increased urinary cAMP Chloride/Phos ratio > 33 is a reliable way to diagnose hyperparathyroidism and frequently tested.
- What studies can be used to localize an adenoma?
 - Non-invasive - U/S, sestamibi, Single photon emission CT (SPECT), MRI
- Best is likely sestamibi with SPECT + U/S
 - Invasive - angiography with venous sampling for PTH gradients
- Reserved for re-operative cases
- What is the treatment for hyperparathyroidism and who should undergo treatment?
 - Parathyroidectomy is only long-term treatment for HPT
 - Clear evidence that symptomatic patients should undergo surgery
- What are the indications for asymptomatic patients to undergo parathyroidectomy?
 - Elevation of Serum Ca 1 mg/dL or more over normal value
 - Decreased Cr Clearance (<60mL/min)
 - T-score < -2 .5

 - Poor access to care/follow-up
 - Age <50
 - Some argue all patients with HPT should get surgery
- How do you confirm adequate intraoperative resection of a parathyroid adenoma?
 - Measure intraoperative rapid PTH assay - Need 50% drop
- How do you treat multi-gland parathyroid disease
 - subtotal parathyroidectomy (3 .5 glands) or total parathyroidectomy with reimplantation into SCM or brachioradialis
- In what patients do you see secondary hyperparathyroidism and what is the treatment?
 - In patients with renal failure
 - Treat with Ca/Vit D supplements, renal diet, phosphate binders
- In what patients do you see tertiary hyperparathyroidism and what is the treatment?
 - Continued high production of PTH despite renal transplant
 - Tx: subtotal parathyroidectomy or subtotal with auto- transplantation
- In what patients would you be concerned for parathyroid cancer and what is the treatment?
 - Generally, have very high calcium levels, may have palpable mass .
 - Rare cause of hyperparathyroidism
 - Tx: En bloc resection with ipsilateral thyroid and central neck dissection
- Recurrence/Metastasis treated with palliative surgery, calcium lowering drugs (bisphosphates/calcimimetics) . Chemorads rarely effective .

Quick Hits
- A patient with high-normal range serum Ca with elevated PTH and evidence of bone loss, what is the diagnosis?
 - Normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism
 - Early form of primary HPT
 - Surgery if symptomatic
- What are the electrolyte disturbances found with hyperparathyroidism:
- Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis
- d/t PTH effect on bicarb excretion in kidney
- Hypophosphatemia
- However, with significant renal impairment, phosphate may be elevated
- A patient with elevated PTH, elevated Ca, Low urinary Ca, what is the diagnosis and treatment?
 - Benign Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia
 - Tx? Nothing
- The inferior thyroid artery supplies parathyroid gland laterally or medially?
 - Medially
- During a neck exploration for hyperparathyroidism you find 3 normal glands and missing superior gland, where should you look next?
 - Check retroesophageal space and open carotid sheath
- During a neck exploration and you find 3 normal glands and missing inferior gland, where should you look next?
 - Check ipsilateral side of mediastinal thymus, consider intra- thyroid gland
- You find 4 normal appearing glands with elevated PTH?
 - Consider hypersecreting, supernumerary parathyroid gland most commonly located in thymus thymectomy

- Where is the most common location of a missed gland?
 - NORMAL anatomic position
- Where is the most common location of an ectopic gland?
 - Thymus

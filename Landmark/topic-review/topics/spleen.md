High Yield Anatomy/Physiology
- Main Ligaments (there are more minor ligaments, but these are the most surgically important)
 - Gastrosplenic → contains short gastrics
 - Splenorenal → contains splenic vessels and tail of pancreas
 - Splenocolic
 - Splenophrenic
- Spleen functions:
 - Store platelets, filter senescent erythrocytes, re-energize erythrocytes through “pitting”, immune function (largest concentration of lymphoid tissue in the body)
- Pitting = removal of intracellular products
 - Opsonization: Tuftsin and Properdin
- Red pulp — Filters RBCs — Most of the spleen — Thin walled sinusoids separated by cords containing red cells
- White pulp — Immune functions
 - Lymphoid follicles — B-cells
 - Periarterial lymphatic sheath (PALS) — T-cells
- Peripheral blood smear suggesting absent/damaged spleen:
 - Howell-Jolly body = Nuclear remnants (most reliable finding)
 - Pappenheimer body = Iron deposits
 - Target cell = Immature RBC
 - Heinz body = Intracellular denatured hemoglobin
 - Spur cell = Deformed membrane
 - What if you don’t see these post-splenectomy
- Accessory spleen

Figure 1 - Figure 1 - Hematologic Consequence of Splenectomy Indications for splenectomy
- Unstable trauma patients
- Hematologic disorders: MC ITP and spherocytosis
- Splenic abscess
- Symptomatic cysts
- Primary malignancies (mainly non-Hodgkins lymphomas) Splenic Trauma
- Can be secondary to iatrogenic trauma from splenic capsular tear with over vigorous retraction during foregut or colon procedures
- Penetrating trauma → splenectomy
- Blunt injury → selective non-operative management

 - Patient must be hemodynamically stable without peritonitis → Otherwise emergent laparotomy and splenectomy
 - Nonoperative management includes in-hospital or ICU monitoring, serial abdominal examinations, serial hematocrit measurements, and a period of immobility (bed rest/post- discharge restricted activity)
 - Angiographic intervention should be considered for:
- AAST grade >III injuries (subcapsular hematoma >50% or expanding; ruptured subcapsular hematoma; laceration >3cm or involving trabecular vessels)
- Presence of contrast blush
- Moderate hemoperitoneum
- Any signs of ongoing splenic bleeding Hematologic Disorders
- Idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP)
 - Thought to be caused by autoantibodies to glycoproteins IIb/ IIIa and Ia/IIa
 - Initial management is medical → Steroids, IVIG
 - Splenectomy for medically refractory cases or for recurrence (avoids need for longstanding steroids)
- Patients who have a good response to steroids → predictive of a favorable response after splenectomy
 - When do you transfuse platelets?
- Only for intraoperative bleeding → give after ligating splenic artery if possible (prevents consumption of transfused platelets)
- Hereditary Spherocytosis
 - Presentation: anemia, splenomegaly
 - Autosomal dominant defect in cell membrane protein (spectrin) → RBC less deformable → culled by spleen
 - Splenectomy recommended for symptomatic patients older than 6 years old (want them to develop immune function prior to splenectomy)

 - Typically, will require cholecystectomy at time of surgery as well (check for gallstones - hemolysis produces bilirubin stones)
- Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency — Congenital hemolytic anemia caused by impaired glucose metabolism - splenectomy reduces transfusion requirements
- Hemoglobinopathies — Sickle cell disease, thalasemias — Rare indication for splenectomy Splenic abscess
- Causes: IV drug use, endocarditis, secondary infection of traumatic pseudocyst, sickle cell disease
- Unilocular with thick wall in stable patient → percutaneous drainage
- Multi-locular, thin walled → suspect echinoccocal abscess → Splenectomy Splenic lesions
- Splenic cyst
 - Well defined hypodense lesion without an enhancing rim
 - Two types
- True cysts: congenital, parasitic (echinococcus), or neoplastic
- False cysts: post traumatic pseudocyst
 - Leave alone if asymptomatic (serology and imaging characteristics can typically rule out parasitic cyst or malignancy)
 - Large cysts (>5cm) or symptomatic → Consider laparoscopic cyst excision or fenestration
- Hemangioma = MC splenic tumor → splenectomy if symptomatic
- Angiosarcoma = primary malignant tumor of spleen
 - Associated with vinyl chloride and thorium dioxide exposure

 - Aggressive, high mortality
 - Splenectomy if caught in time
- Non-Hodgkins lymphoma
 - MC CLL → Splenectomy for anemia/thrombocytopenia Splenic artery aneurysm
- MC visceral artery aneurysm, more common in women
- When to treat?
 - >2cm
 - All pregnant women or women of childbearing age, regardless of size (As high as 70% rupture risk during pregnancy
- Treatment → Usually endovascular coil embolization of the aneurysm or placement of covered stent
 - Very distal aneurysms may require splenectomy
 - Tradition open or laparoscopic splenic artery ligation also acceptable options Post splenectomy infection
- Decreased IgM and IgG leads to increased susceptibility to encapsulated organisms (S . pneumoniae, N . meningitidis, H . influenza)
 - Timing of vaccination?
- 2 weeks prior to elective splenectomy or prior to hospital discharge following emergent splenectomy (or 2 weeks post-op if reliable follow-up)
- OPSI risk is higher in children — especially in hematologic disease (Beta thalassemia)
- If suspicion of OPSI → Broad spectrum antibiotics immediately! — Don’t wait for cultures
- Prophylactic antibiotics?
 - Consider for children <10 years old
 - Definitely not in adults

Quick Hits
- Patient s/p splenectomy for ITP with persistent thrombocytopenia . Periepheral smear with Howel-jolly bodies?
 - Accessory spleen
 - Diagnose with imaging: radionuclide spleen scan (tagged RBC scan)
 - MC location: splenic hilum
- MC organism associated with OPSI?
 - S . pneumo
- Abdominal pain and CT with spleen in RLQ, abdominal U/S shows no flow in splenic vein. Diagnosis?
 - Wandering spleen
- Caused by failure of fusion of dorsal mesogastrium, leading to lack of splenic ligaments
- Risk of splenic torsion and infarction
 - Treatment?
- Splenectomy if splenic infarction, otherwise splenopexy
- MC source of post splenectomy bleeding?
 - Short gastrics
- Patient with abdominal pain following splenectomy . CT shows large, low attenuation, contained fluid collection in surgical bed/lesser sac . Diagnosis?
 - Pancreatic leak — tail of pancreas at risk during splenectomy
 - Treatment?
- Percutaneous drain
- Patient with fever, hemolytic anemia, renal failure, purpura, neurologic changes . Diagnosis and management?
 - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)
 - FAT-RN mnemonic (Fever, Anemia, Thrombocytopenia, Renal, Neurological)
 - Caused by defective ADAMTS13 metalloproteinase (vWF cleaving protein) → Platelet aggregation in microvasculature
 - Treatment = Plasmapheresis

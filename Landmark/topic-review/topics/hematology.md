- A patient with a platelet disorder will have what coagulation lab abnormality?
 - Increased bleeding time (PT and PTT not reliably affected)
- What is the most common congenital bleeding disorder? And what are the different types
 - Von Willebrand’s Disease
- Type I - Most common, reduced quantity of vWf, treat with desmopressin (for most patients) or cryoprecipitate
- Type II - Dysfunctional vWF , treat with desmopressin or cryoprecipitate
- Type III - Complete absence of vWF, desmopressin does not work, must use cryoprecipitate or Factor VIII replacement
- What bleeding disorders is cryoprecipitate helpful in?
 - Von Willebrand’s, hypofibrinogenemia, hemophilia A
- What are the factors missing in Hemophilia A and Hemophilia B
 - Hemophilia A = Factor VIII, prolongation of PTT
- Treat with factor VIII or cryo
 - Hemophilia B = Factor IX, prolongation of PTT
- Treat with factor IX or FFP
- Coumadin = WEPT = Warfarin Extrinsic pathway PT
- PTT = intrinsic pathway
- A patient on coumadin undergoes surgery and following surgery platelets drop >50%, what tests to confirm the diagnosis? Treatment?
 - Concern for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia
 - Clinical suspicion with 4Ts score (thrombocytopenia, timing, thrombosis, and other possible causes)
 - ELISA testing anti-platelet-factor-4 for initial screening
 - Serotonin release assay for confirmation

 - Stop heparin immediately with sufficient clinical suspicion
 - Start safe anticoagulation (argatroban is classic; bivalirudin or fondaparinux also options)
- Patient presents with DVT and strong family history of DVT . What heritable blood clotting disorders would be on your differential?
 - Factor V Leiden
 - Prothrombin Gene Defect 20210
 - Protein C and S Deficiency
 - Antithrombin 3 Deficiency
 - Hyperhomocystenemia
- A patient is started on Coumadin and develops skin necrosis, what is the name of this phenomena and what is its pathophysiology?
 - Warfarin induced skin necrosis
 - Seen in patients with protein C and S deficiency
 - Short half-life of protein C and S (natural anticoagulants), leads to brief period of time where patient is hypercoagulable
 - Important to bridge with Lovenox when starting coumadin
- Patients with hyperhomocysteinemia, how to treat this?
 - Folic acid and B12
- How does antithrombin III deficiency present itself, and how do you treat it?
 - They do not respond to heparin
 - Treat with ATIII concentrate or FFP, prior to heparin admin
 - Then start on long-term anticoagulant
- Mechanism of action of heparin? And how to reverse?
 - Potentiates ATIII, makes it 1000x more potent
 - Protamine to reverse
- Can cause hypotension and bradycardia

- What are characteristics of antiphospholipid syndrome, how do you diagnose and how do you treat it?
 - History - symptoms of Lupus, prior DVTs, or recurrent pregnancy losses
 - Will have prolonged PTT but are hypercoaguable
 - Caused by antibodies to cardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant
 - Treat with heparin bridge to coumadin
- What is mechanism of action of Warfarin?
 - Inhibits VKORC (a protein that reduces Vitamin K to activate it)
 - Inhibits creation of Factors X, IX, VII, II (1972) and protein and C and S
 - Contraindicated in pregnant patients
- Warfarin reversal agents and their times to onset
 - Administer Vit K (6 hours)
 - FFP (<1 hour)
 - Prothrombin Concentrate Complex (immediate)
- How do determine effectiveness of Lovenox
 - Check factor Xa levels
 - Unlike heparin, Lovenox is only weakly reversed by protamine
- Reversal agents for direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)
 - Dabigatran (Pradaxa)
- Can be reversed with dialysis
- And idarucizumab (Praxbind; monoclonal Ab that inactivates it)
 - Apixaban (Eliquis) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto)
- Can be reversed with andexanet alfa (Andexxa; decoy- receptor for factor Xa inhibitor molecules)

- What is mechanism of action of tPA? How to reverse it?
 - Activates plasminogen, breaks down fibrinogen
 - Aminocaproic acid
- What are contraindications to using tPA?
 - Absolute
- Active internal bleeding
- Recent CVA or neurosurgery
- Recent GI bleed, or intracranial pathology
 - Relative contraindications
- Surgery past 10 days
- Recent organ biopsies, recent delivery
- Recent major trauma
- Uncontrolled hypertension
- Which coagulation factors are not synthesized in the liver?
 - Factor VIII, and Desmopressin
- When to use FFP
 - FFP has all coagulation factors
 - Any coagulation disorder including Antithrombin III deficiency

- What factors are measured by PT/INR
 - Measures external pathway - factors II, VII, IX, X (1972)
 - Best test for liver synthetic function
 - Goal INR of 2-3 generally in anticoagulated patients
- What factors are measured by PTT
 - All except VII
 - Goal of 60-90 in anticoagulated patients Quick Hits
- Thrombin (factor II) is key to coagulation
 - Fibrinogen to fibrin
 - Activates platelets
- Fibrin links platelets (GpIIb/IIIa molecules) to form a platelet plug
- Antithrombin III is key to anticoagulation
 - Binds and inhibits thrombin
 - Heparin activates AT-III
- What factors are made in liver?
 - All except VIII and vWF
- Factor with the shortest half-life
 - Factor VII
- What factors does warfarin block?
 - Vit K dependent factors: II, VII, IX, X, protein C and S
- What does cryo contain?
 - High concentrations of vWF, VIII, and fibrinogen
- What is in FFP
 - All clotting factors, some fibrinogen

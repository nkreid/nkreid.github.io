PART ONE High Yield Anatomy
- What structures are in the portal triad?
 - Common bile duct
 - Proper hepatic artery (medial)
 - Portal vein (posterior)
 - Runs in hepatoduodenal ligament
- What separates the right and left lobes of the liver?
 - Cantlie’s Line (line between gallbladder fossa and IVC)
- What numbers correspond to the anatomic liver segments?
 - I = caudate lobe
 - II-III = left lateral segments
 - IV = left inferior anteromedial
 - V = right inferior anteromedial
 - VI-VII = right posterior lateral
 - VIII = right superior anteromedial
- What is the venous drainage?
 - 3 hepatic veins → drain into IVC
 - Medial and left hepatic vein usually merge before draining into IVC
- What are the most common aberrant vascular anatomy?
 - Replaced right hepatic - most commonly off the SMA, travels behind pancreas and CBD
 - Replaced left hepatic - most commonly off the left gastric, travels in gastrohepatic ligament

During foregut surgery, take care not to ligate a replaced left traveling in the gastrohepatic ligament.

Figure 1 - Segmental anatomy of the liver Benign Biliary Disease
 - What is the management of asymptomatic gallstones?
- Observation
 - What about uncomplicated symptomatic cholelithiasis?
- Elective cholecystectomy
 - How do you manage symptomatic cholelithiasis in pregnancy?
- Higher rates of spontaneous abortion with non-operative management
- Laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the second trimester
- Place ports via open Hassan technique
- Keep pneumoperitoneum as low as possible
- Place bump under right side to offload cava
 - How do you manage acute cholecystitis?
- Early cholecystectomy if surgically fit

There is no benefit to waiting or “cooling off” acute cholecystitis with antibiotics.

- Cholecystostomy tube if unable to tolerate surgery
- If recovered from their critical illness → interval cholecystectomy
 - Recurrent symptoms are common after cholecystostomy tube removal
 - What is the management of suspected choledocholithiasis?
- Several acceptable approaches and much variability between institutions, but in general:
- Strong suspicion (CBD stone on imaging, clinical cholangitis, bilirubin > 3, dilated CBD > 6 mm) → consider preop ERCP for duct clearance
 - IOC and possible CBD exploration if ERCP not available
- Moderate suspicion (abnormal liver tests other than bili, mild elevation in bili, clinical gallstone pancreatitis) → MRCP or IOC
- Low suspicion (no biochemical or imaging suggestive of CBD stone) → no further investigation prior to cholecystectomy
- CBD stones identified during IOC → flush + glucagon up to twice
- If small stone and large enough cystic duct → transcystic CBD exploration using fluoroscopic guidance or choledochoscope
- If not amenable to transcystic approach → either lap CBD exploration or postop ERCP depending on resources available and surgeon experience
- What if you can’t visualize the hepatic ducts on IOC?
- Pull catheter back and try flushing again
- Trendelenburg to see if change in imaging (back filling using gravity)

- Convert to open to investigate injury to hepatic duct
 - Gallstone pancreatitis
- Do you need to perform ERCP?
- Only if clinical signs of cholangitis
- Stone will likely pass and no improvement of outcomes with early ERCP in patients with gallstone pancreatitis alone
- When do you perform cholecystectomy?
- Should be done during index admission after clinical pancreatitis resolves
- In severe cases with significant peripancreatic fluid collections → wait until fluid collections mature or regress → interval cholecystectomy at 6 weeks is acceptable, but an ERCP with sphincterotomy should be performed to reduce risk of complications during waiting period
 - What is gallstone ileus?
- Small bowel obstruction caused by a gallstone (typically at IC valve) resulting from a cholecystoenteric fistula (usually fistula to duodenum)
- What is the Rigler triad?
- Bowel obstruction
- Gallstone seen in intestine
- Pneumobilia on imaging
- How do you treat this?
- Primary goal: relieve the obstruction
 - Perform enterotomy proximal to obstruction and milk stone back and remove through enterotomy
- Should you perform cholecystectomy and fistula takedown at the time of enterolithotomy?
 - No
 - A combined procedure has higher morbidity and recurrence rates are low

 - Can consider in select circumstances: patient stable and gangrenous cholecystitis present (in other words they’re stable and REALLY need their gallbladder out) 99% of the time the answer is enterotomy and milk the stone. Avoid cholecystectomy and fistula takedown.
 - What are gallbladder polyps?
- Majority are benign hyperplastic polyps
- Management
- Symptomatic → cholecystectomy
- Asymptomatic → cholecystectomy if > 10 mm in size
 - If over 18 mm → treat as gallbladder cancer until proven otherwise
 - Polyps over 6 mm need serial imaging or consider surgery to avoid need for surveillance Portal Hypertension
 - What is the hepatic vein pressure gradient (HVPG)?
- Gradient between the wedged hepatic vein pressure and the free hepatic vein pressure - requires passage of balloon catheter into hepatic vein under fluoroscopy
- Portal hypertension defined as (HVPG) > 6 mmHg
 - What are the clinical effects of portal hypertension?
- Portosystemic venous collaterals, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, splenomegaly
 - What is the relationship between the site of increased portal resistance and the etiology of portal hypertension?
- Presinusoidal → e .g . schistosomiasis
- Sinusoidal → e .g . alcoholic cirrhosis, viral hepatitis
- Postsinusoidal → Budd-Chiari syndrome
- Many are mixed disorders (e .g . primary biliary cirrhosis has both presinusoidal and sinusoidal elements)

 - What are the sites of collateral circulation?
- Where splanchnic venous system meets with systemic drainage
- Distal esophagus/proximal stomach (esophageal submucosal veins to proximal gastric veins)
- Rectum (IMV to pudendal vein)
- Umbilicus (vestigial umbilical vein to left portal vein)
- Retroperitoneum (mesenteric and ovarian veins)
 - How do you treat it?
- Pharmacologic
- Splanchnic vasoconstrictors in acute setting = vasopressin, octreotide
- Non-selective beta-blockers for prophylaxis = nadolol, propranolol
- Endoscopic variceal banding
- Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)
- Used for acute or recurrent variceal bleeding, refractory ascites, Budd-Chiari syndrome, or hepatic hydrothorax
 - What is the management of acute esophageal variceal bleeding?
- Resuscitate, transfuse, antibiotics, intubation for airway protection
- Octreotide → endoscopic treatment → TIPS if uncontrolled (balloon tamponade as temporizing measure)
- If rebleed after initial endoscopic control → 2nd endoscopy → consider TIPS
 - What are the surgical options for portal hypertension?
- Gastroesophageal devascularization
- Generally reserved for patients with extensive portal venous thrombosis and no portosystemic shunt options

- Esophageal transection with division and anastomosis
- Rarely used since TIPS
- Devascularization procedures
- Total devascularization of the greater curvature and upper 2/3rd of the lesser curvature and circumferential devascularization of the lower 7 .5 cm of the esophagus
- Portosystemic shunts
- Selective shunts (e.g. distal splenorenal or “Warren” shunt)
 - Decompress only part of portal venous system
 - Good for variceal bleeding but does not help ascites
- Partial portosystemic shunts
 - Type of side to side shunt where flow is calibrated by the size of the synthetic interposition graft placed between the portal vein and vena cava
- Nonselective portosystemic shunts
 - Decompress the entire portal venous system
 - Side to side portocaval shunt is most common
 - High rate of encephalopathy and complicate later liver transplant Variceal bleeding → selective shunt. Ascites → nonselective shunt.

Figure 2 - Vascular anatomy of portosystemic shunts Liver Abscess
 - What types of abscesses can be found in the liver?
- Pyogenic abscess (most common, > 80%)
- Usually secondary to biliary tract infection (E . coli most common pathogen), GI source (diverticulitis, appendicitis)
- Treatment = percutaneous drain and antibiotics
- Ameobic abscess
- Typical presentation is patient with liver abscess after travel to Mexico

- Get serology
- Treatment = metronidazole, rarely needs drainage
- Echinococcal cyst
- Hydatid cyst
- Characteristic double walled cyst on CT
- Check serology
- Treatment = albendazole followed by surgical excision
 - Do not aspirate or spill → cause anaphylaxis Quick Hits
- What hepatic vein pressure gradient is typically required for variceal rupture?
 - 12 mmHg
 - What is the definition of portal HTN?
- 6 mmHg
- What are the components of the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score?
 - Bilirubin, albumin, prothrombin time, encephalopathy, ascites
- What are the components of the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score?
 - Bilirubin, INR, creatinine
- What is the MELD score at which patients have a survival benefit for transplantation?
 - 15
- What is the management of umbilical hernias in a cirrhotic with ascites?
 - Ideally done in elective setting
 - Medically control ascites first
- Control of ascites is key to reduce hernia recurrence and postoperative complications, such as wound infection, evisceration, ascites drainage, and peritonitis
- If medical treatment of ascites doesn’t work → intermittent

paracentesis, temporary peritoneal dialysis catheter or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt may be necessary
- Use mesh in the elective setting
 - If patient eligible for transplant → repair hernia at time of transplant
 - If complicated (incarcerated, strangulated, ruptured) → must repair urgently
- No mesh, close in layers (close peritoneum), sterile dressing
- Aggressive ascites control postop until healed Avoid leaving an intraperitoneal drain on the exam - patient can get hypotensive. Intermittent paracentesis is the standard.

- How do you manage symptomatic cholelithiasis in a patient with cirrhosis and ascites?
 - Medically manage until cirrhosis is compensated, then laparoscopic cholecystectomy by an experienced liver surgeon .
 - Replace clotting factors and platelets preop if necessary PART TWO Cystic Hepatobiliary Lesions
 - What are choledochal cysts?
- Unknown etiology but likely secondary to an anomalous biliary-pancreatic duct junction with reflux of pancreatic enzymes (long common BP duct)
- Most are identified and treated in early childhood
- Can cause, pain, biliary obstruction, cirrhosis
- Carry malignant potential

 - What is the Todani classification system and treatment by type?
- I - Fusiform dilation of extrahepatic biliary tree
- Resection with hepaticojejunostomy
- II - Saccular diverticulum of CBD
- Excision of cyst - likely with RNY biliary enteric reconstruction
- III - Dilation of intramural duct (choledochocele)
- Uncommon - approach transduodenally → transduodenal excision or sphincteroplasty
- IVa - Multiple dilations of intra and extra-hepatic ducts
- Hepatic resection and biliary reconstruction
- IVb - Multiple dilations of extra-hepatic ducts
- Excision and hepaticojejunostomy
- V - Multiple dilations of intrahepatic ducts (Caroli’s)
- Transplantation (can have one attempt at partial resection if isolated to one part of liver)

Figure 3 - Types of choledochal cysts
 - How do you manage a simple hepatic cyst?
- No treatment if asymptomatic
- 100% recurrence rate with aspiration alone
- Laparoscopic cyst fenestration for symptomatic cysts → send capsule for pathology

- If concern for abscess, hydatid cyst, or malignancy → aspirate for cytology Hepatobiliary Tumors
 - What are the characteristics of a hepatic hemangioma?
- Most common liver tumor, male predominance, equal distribution in liver
- Congenital vascular malformations, generally asymptomatic
- Can cause pain, compressive symptoms
- Rarely hemorrhage, inflammation, or coagulopathy
- Kasabach-Merritt Syndrome = hemangioma + consumptive coagulopathy
- Imaging
- CT: hypodense pre-contrast; peripheral → central enhancement in the arterial phase; persistent contrast on delayed series
- MRI: hypointense on T1; hyperintense on T2
- Treatment
- Asymptomatic → observation (regardless of size, no risk of rupture)
- Symptomatic → resection
 - Focal Nodular Hyperplasia
- 2nd most common liver tumor, women 30-50 years old
- Completely benign, usually asymptomatic
- Imaging
- CT: well demarcated; rapid arterial enhancement with central stellate scar
- MRI: hypointense with central scar on T1; isointense with hyperintense scar on T2
- Treatment
- Nothing - no malignant potential, no bleeding risk

 - Adenoma
- Rare, associated with OCP and androgen steroid use
- Malignant transformation in 10%
- Risk of rupture increases with size → 30% risk of spontaneous bleeding with tumors > 5 cm
- Can present with pain, abdominal fullness, abnormal LFTs, or bleeding from rupture
- Imaging
- CT: arterial enhancement with washout on portal phase; smooth surface with tumor capsule; no central scar
- MRI: mildly hyperintense on T1 and T2
- Treatment
- Small lesions → discontinue OCPs and it may regress
- Larger lesions (> 4 cm) or no regression after stopping OCPs → resect
- Ruptured → IR embolization, recover, then resect in elective setting Positive sulfur colloid uptake = functioning Kupffer cells → FNH Negative sulfur colloid uptake = absent Kupffer cells, from hepatocytes → adenoma

Figure 4 - Cross sectional imaging of benign hepatic lesions
 - What are the features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)?
- Risk factors (causes of liver inflammation)
- HBV, HCV, cirrhosis of any cause, inherited errors of metabolism (hemochromatosis, alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency), aflatoxin
- CT scan: hypervascular lesions; hyperintense during arterial phase; hypodense during the delayed phase
- Characteristic lesion on imaging + elevated AFP = no biopsy needed
- Is there a role for PET/CT?
- No role in HCC
- What is the most common site of metastasis?

- Lung
- What is the management?
- Resection indicated for cure if solitary mass without major vascular invasion and adequate liver function (i .e . low grade with normal function or Childs A without portal hypertension)
 - Resection is possible but controversial for limited major vascular invasion or multifocal disease that is resectable
- How much FLR (future liver remnant) is needed?
 - No cirrhosis → 25%
 - Childs A → 30-40%
 - What if less than above but otherwise resectable disease?
- Consider preop portal vein embolization of diseased side
- No cirrhosis or Childs A and early stage → resection
- Moderate to severe cirrhosis and early stage → Transplant
 - Must meet Milan criteria:
- One lesion < 5 cm
- 3 or fewer lesions all less than 3 cm and no gross vascular or extrahepatic spread

Figure 5 - Milan criteria
 - Usually perform neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to transplant
- Locoregional therapies should be considered in patients who are not candidates for surgical curative treatments, or as a bridge to curative therapy
 - Ablation (radiofrequency, cryoablation, microwave) = best for small lesions < 5 cm
 - Arterially directed therapies - transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)
- Consider for unresectable tumors > 5 cm
 - External beam radiation therapy
- Also an option for unresectable disease
- Good for lesions not amenable to ablation or TACE due to tumor location
 - What are the features of cholangiocarcinoma?
- Classified as intrahepatic or extrahepatic disease
- Risk factors (inflammation of bile ducts): primary sclerosing cholangitis, bile duct stones, choledochal cysts, liver fluke infections, HBV, HCV

- What is the management of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma?
- Preop biopsy is not necessary if radiographically and clinically suggested malignancy
- Diagnostic laparoscopy to rule out disseminated disease recommended
 - Lymph node metastasis past porta hepatis and distant metastases contraindicate resection
 - Multifocal liver disease is generally not amenable to resection Unlike hepatocellular carcinoma, transplantation is NOT an option for multifocal cholangiocarcinoma.

- Hepatic resection with negative margin is goal (formal anatomic resection, wedge resection, or segmental resection)
- What is the management of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma?
- Basic principle is complete resection with negative margins and regional lymphadenectomy
- Location is hilar, how do you resect?
 - In order to be resectable, contralateral hemi-liver must have intact arterial/portal flow and biliary drainage uninvolved with tumor
 - Reconstruction generally with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy
- Location is distal, how do you resect?
 - Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple)
 - What are the features of gallbladder carcinoma?
- Risk factors: chronic inflammation, porcelain gallbladder (much lower risk than previously thought), polyps > 1 cm, typhoid infection, primary sclerosing cholangitis, IBD
- Many discovered incidentally at time of cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallbladder disease

- Surgical management
- T1a tumors (invades lamina propria) → cholecystectomy alone
- T1b and greater (invades muscle layer) → cholecystectomy with limited hepatic resection (typically segments IVb and V) and portal lymphadenectomy
 - More extensive resection may be required for more advanced disease in order to obtain negative margins Quick Hits
- Patient with colorectal cancer and isolated liver metastasis receives neoadjuvant FOLFOX therapy, restaging shows complete radiologic response . Next step?
 - Still perform hepatic resection as complete pathologic response is rare Same principle as rectal cancer that has clinically resolved after neoadjuvant
- Patient with asymptomatic cholelithiasis and a 5 mm gallbladder polyp . Next step?
 - Cholecystectomy
 - Risk of malignant transformation within gallbladder polyps has been linked to concurrent cholelithiasis → surgery recommended regardless of polyp size if concurrent stones
- Highest negative predictive value test for choledocholithiasis?
 - GGT (beta-glutamyl transpeptidase) → normal GGT has 97% NPV
- How do you manage choledocholithiasis in patient with prior Roux-en-Y gastric bypass?
 - Transgastric ERCP or advanced double-balloon endoscopy

- What is the significance of HCC found in young patient without cirrhosis?
 - Fibrolamellar variant
 - Better prognosis, recurrence is common
 - Marker?
- Neurotensin
- Incidental finding of adenocarcinoma invading lamina propria layer of gallbladder following cholecystectomy . Next step?
 - No further treatment → cholecystectomy alone is enough
- Incidental finding of adenocarcinoma following cholecystectomy . Next step?
 - Stage
 - Go back to OR for resection of segments IVb and V and portal lymphadenectomy
 - Do you need to excise port sites?
- No benefit
- What is the significance of isolated gastric varices?
 - Most commonly caused by splenic vein thrombosis secondary to pancreatitis
 - Treatment = splenectomy
- Patient 4 weeks after hospitalization for car accident with liver laceration that was managed nonoperatively presents with upper GI bleed . Management?
 - First step = EGD → you see blood coming from the duodenal papilla
 - What is this?
- Hemobilia from hepatic artery-biliary duct fistula
- Treatment = angioembolization
- What segments do you take in a right liver resection?
 - 5-8
 - Left?

- 2-4 +/- caudate (1)
 - Left lateral segmentectomy?
- 2-3
 - Extended right?
- 5-8 + 4
 - Extended left?
- 2-4 + 5 and 8

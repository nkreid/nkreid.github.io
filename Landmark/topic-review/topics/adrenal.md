High Yield Anatomy Vascular supply
- Superior: phrenic artery
- Middle: aorta
- Inferior: renal artery Left vein drains into left renal vein, right vein drains into the IVC Adrenal Cortex (Mesoderm) +Medulla (Ectoderm) Neuroendocrine in origin chromaffin cells
- Zona Glomerulosa: “Salt” - regulates aldosterone
- Zona Fasicularis: “Sugar”- glucocorticoids
- Zona Reticularis: “Sex”- androgens/estrogen Incidentaloma:
- 1-2% found incidentally on imaging
- Concerning features of >4-6 cm, >10 HU, enlarging, and functioning
- Always look for functioning tumors before biopsy
- Send urine urine metanephrines/VMA/catecholamines, urinary hydroxycorticosteroids, serum K with plasma renin and aldosterone levels

Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia
- 21 and 11 beta hydroxylase are crucial to convert cholesterol to aldosterone, cortisol, and testosterone
- 21 hydroxylase deficiency: increased testosterone and decreased aldosterone
- 11 hydroxylase deficiency: increased testosterone and increased aldosterone
- 17 hydroxylase deficiency: decreased testosterone and increased aldosterone Hyperalderosteronism: Conn’s syndrome
- Hypertension because of sodium preservation and K wasting
- Primary: renin low, Secondary: renin high
- Plasma aldosterone: renin >25
- Bilateral idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia is MC reason in 60- 65% (manage medically)
- Dx: with salt load suppression test, urine aldosterone will remain elevated
- Localize on CT, MRI, NP-59 scintigraphy or Adrenal venous sampling
- Tx: spironolactones, CCB like nifedipine and K replacement
- Surgery: adrenalectomy
- If bilateral, will need fludrocortisone postoperatively Hypocortisolism (Addison’s disease)
- Decreased cortisol and aldosterone with high ACTH
- Dx: cosyntropin testing- cortisol remains low
- Acute Adrenal insufficiency: refractory hypotension, fevers, lethargy, pain, N/V

- Tx: Dexamethasone, fluids
- Chronic: Give corticosteroids Hypercortisolism Cushing’s syndrome
- Most commonly exogenous
- Measure 24-hour cortisol or urinary cortisol and late-night cortisol
- ACTH low—look for adrenal adenoma
- Adrenalectomy when dx on CT scan
- ACTH high—look for pituitary tumors (Cushing’s DISEASE) or ectopic producer like small cell lung cancer
- Cushing’s disease: #1 cause, Brain MRI followed by transsphenoidal approach resection
- Ectopic ACTH: #2 cause, CT CAP, resection Adrenocortical Carcinoma
- Typically present at advanced stages, rare malignancy
- Very aggressive, patients present with Cushing syndrome, virilization and HTN
- Radical adrenalectomy with debulking, mitotane for adjuvant/ recurrent disease Pheochromocytoma
- Rule of 10: 10% are malignant, bilateral, in children, familial, and extra-adrenal
- Only adrenal pheochromocytomas will produce epinephrine because of PNMT enzyme
- Can be seen on MIBG (when imaging does not show mass)
- Preoperative prep included volume replacement, alpha blockade with phenoxybenzamine or prazosin, followed by beta blockade
- Tx: adrenalectomy (ligate adrenal veins first to avoid spillage)
- Additional sites are paragangliomas; MC is organ of Zuckerkandl

Quick Hits
- Clonidine suppression test for patients with suspected pheochromocytoma but normotensive
- MC reason for Cushing Syndrome - Exogenous steroids
- MC reason for Addison Disease (adrenal insufficiency) - Autoimmune (1st world) or Tuberculosis (3rd world)

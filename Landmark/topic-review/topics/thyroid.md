High Yield Anatomy Figure 1: Thyroid Anatomy (Thyroid in Grey) Vascular supply:
- Superior thyroid artery: branch from External carotid artery
- Inferior thyroid artery: branch off of thyrocervical artery
- Ima artery off of innominate directly to the isthmus
- Superior thyroid vein drains into IJV, inferior drains into innominate vein Nerves:
- Superior laryngeal nerve: motor to cricothyroid muscle; loss of projection and fatigue
- Recurrent laryngeal nerve: Right travels with vagus and loops around Right innominate artery

- Left travels with vagus and loops around aorta
- Preoperative laryngoscopy to visualize cords, bilateral damage can obstruct airway Thyroglobulin: stores T3 (more active) and T4 Thyroid Embryology: 4th Endodermal pouch → Bilobed solid organ---follicular cells, colloid and parafollicular cells (produces calcitonin) Pyramidal lobe extension can cause thyroglossal duct cyst; resect this as it has the potential to get infected or malignant transformation High-Yield Pathophysiology/Treatment
- Thyroid storm:
 - Seen in Grave’s disease
 - Treatment with beta blockers, Lugol’s solution, cooling blankets
- Thyroid Nodule:
 - Ultrasound (Look for hypoechogenecity, microcalcification, irregular margins, unorganized vascular patterns, lymphatic invasion) followed by FNA -	Indeterminant -	Repeat FNA -	Benign -	Repeat US in 6-12 months -	AUS/FLUS -	Repeat FNA -	Follicular neoplasm -	Lobectomy -	Suspicious malignancy -	Lobectomy -	Malignancy -	Total thyroidectomy Table 1: Bethesda Criteria *AUS - Atypia of undetermined significance **FLUS - Follicular lesion of undetermined significance

- Hyperthyroidism:
 - Low TSH, elevated T3, T4
 - Treatment with PTU (side effects of aplastic anemia or agranulocytosis) or methimazole (cretinism, aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis)
 - PTU OK during Pregnancy as it does not cross placenta
- Graves’ disease:
 - Diffuse uptake of radioactive iodine (RAI), antibodies against TSH receptors
 - RAI worsens ophthalmopathy
- Multi-nodular goiter:
 - Total or subtotal thyroidectomy
- Thyroiditis:
 - Hashimoto’s: caused by antithyroid antibodies; treatment with thyroid replacement
 - Subacute granulomatous: viral etiology, treatment with NSAIDs, steroids
- Papillary thyroid cancer:
 - MC thyroid malignancy; in women; spread lymphatically
 - Biopsy pathology shows psammoma bodies, orphan Annie nucleus
 - Tx with total thyroidectomy with Level VI involvement
- Do total - so can follow up thyroglobulin for surveillance, postoperative radioiodine treatment, remove potential multifocal disease
- Follicular Thyroid Cancer:
 - FNA is not reliable so do diagnostic/therapeutic lobectomy
 - Hematogenous spread
 - Treatment with total thyroidectomy, MRND for + nodes and postoperative Radioactive iodine ablation

- Medullary Thyroid Cancer:
 - Cancer from parafollicular C cells producing Calcitonin
 - 20% associated with germline mutations in RET oncogene
 - Tx with total thyroidectomy with Central dissection, modified radical dissection if lymph nodes involved
 - Surveillance with CEA, Calcitonin Table 2: MEN and Medullary Thyroid Cancer Quick Hits
 - Radioactive Iodine ablation does not work for MTC
 - Avoid injuring the Superior Laryngeal Nerve by ligation close to the superior pole of the thyroid
 - MC symptom of elevated calcitonin is diarrhea

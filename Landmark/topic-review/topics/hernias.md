Basic Principles Underlying principle of good hernia repair = Tension free Most common cause for recurrent hernia = wound infection Rank as cause of SBO = 2nd to adhesion (worldwide = 1st) Figure 1 - Abdominal Wall Anatomy Abdominal Wall Anatomy
- Layers of abdominal wall just off midline:
 - Skin
 - Subcutaneous Fat/Camper’s Fascia
 - Scarpa’s Fascia
 - Anterior Rectus Sheath
 - Rectus Muscle
 - Posterior Rectus Sheath
 - Preperitoneal Fat
 - Peritoneum
- Layers of abdominal wall lateral to rectus:
 - Skin
 - Subcutaneous Fat/Camper’s Fascia

 - Scarpa’s Fascia
 - External Oblique
 - Internal Oblique
 - Transversus Abdominis
 - Transversalis Fascia
 - Preperitoneal Fat
 - Peritoneum
- Where does rectus sheath end?
 - Arcuate line (third of distance between umbilicus and pubis symphysis)
- Bloody supply to the rectus?
 - Inferior and Superior Epigastrics
- Hesselbach’s Triangle Anatomy
 - Medial Border - Rectus
 - Inferior Border - Inguinal Ligament
 - Lateral Border - Epigastrics
 - Hernia in Hesselbach’s triangle = Direct Hernia
- What is the inguinal ligament?
 - Extension of the external oblique fascia
- What are the embryological structures that are at or go through umbilicus?
 - Omphalomesenteric duct (Vitelline duct) → Becomes Meckel’s Diverticulum
 - Median umbilical ligament → urachus
 - Medial umbilical ligaments → obliterated umbilical arteries
 - Round ligament of the liver (ligamentum teres) → obliterated umbilical vein
- When does the midgut herniate? And what does it return?
 - Herniates at 6 weeks
 - Returns at 10 weeks

- Abdominal wall defect in Omphalocele? Gastroschisis?
 - Omphalocele → Through the umbilical stalk
 - Gastroschisis → Inferior/Right of the umbilicus Umbilical Hernias
- Usually congenital
- Usual contents → preperitoneal fat
- Repair options?
 - Open vs . Laparoscopic
 - Primary repair → <1cm and pediatric patients
- 2 yo with umbilical hernia
 - Wait until 5yo to see if it will close and then repair
 - Fix before going to school Inguinal Hernias
- What defines indirect/direct hernia?
 - Indirect is lateral to inferior epigastrics
 - Direct is medial to inferior epigastrics
- Etiology of indirect?
 - Congenital - Patent processus vaginalis
- Etiology of direct?
 - Acquired - Weakness in floor of inguinal canal
- Risk factors for direct?
 - Obesity, smoking, poor nutrition, ascites, anything with increased abdominal pressure
- Contents of spermatic cord?
 - Cremasteric muscles, testicular artery, vas deferens, pampiniform plexus, ilioinguinal nerve, genital branch of genitofemoral nerve
- What forms the cremaster muscles?
 - Extension of the internal oblique muscle fibers

- What are the key nerves in open inguinal hernia repair?
 - Ilioinguinal
 - Genital branch of genitofemoral
 - Iliohypogastric
 - MC injured → Ilioinguinal (when opening external oblique)
- MC injured nerve in laparoscopic hernia repair
 - Lateral femoral cutaneous
- Occurs from improperly placed tack laterally
- Bassini
 - Conjoint tendon (transversalis + internal oblique) to inguinal ligament
- Shouldice
 - Same as bassini in multiple (4) layers
- Lichtenstein repair
 - Repair with mesh, sew inguinal ligament to conjoined/ transversalis
- Plug and patch
 - Plug goes into internal repair and then Lichtenstein on top
- Pediatric repair basics?
 - High ligation of sac
- Laparoscopic hernia repair
 - Total Extra-Peritoneal Repair (TEP) and Trans-Abdominal Pre-Peritoneal Repair (TAPP)
 - Repair covers internal, direct, and femoral spaces
 - Main structure of fixation in laparoscopic repair?
- Cooper’s ligament
 - What and where is the triangle of doom?
- Contains Iliac vessels, medial with apex at iliopubic tract and bounded by vas deferens medially and spermatic vessels laterally

 - What and where is the triangle of pain?
- Contains Nerve structures, lateral to spermatic vessels below iliopubic tract Femoral Hernias
- Who is at highest risk for femoral hernias?
 - Females and elderly
- Where is the defect?
 - Below the inguinal ligament, medial to the femoral vein
- How do you repair it open?
 - McVay (Cooper’s) Repair
- Open inguinal floor, close femoral space by suturing Conjoint tendon to Cooper’s Ligament Incarceration vs. Strangulation
- What are the signs of symptoms?
 - Obstructive, non-reducible hernia, skin changes, severe tenderness and pain
- Open approach and needed bowel resection . How do you repair?
 - Biologic mesh or tissue repair Ventral/Incisional Hernias
- Risks Factors for incisional hernia?
 - Wound infection, obesity, COPD, smoking
 - GET THEM TO STOP SMOKING prior to elective repair
 - Where can you place the mesh?
- Underlay, inlay, onlay
- Highest recurrence in inlay mesh
- Choose macroporous mesh
- Biologic mesh if contamination
 - How to manage large ventral hernia if you cannot obtain

primary closure?
- Component separation -- There are several types/ variations. A common board question regards which layer is incised (See Image) .
- Anterior Component Separation (incise external oblique)
- Transversus Abdominis Repair (incise transversus abdominis)
- Posterior Component Separation (incise posterior rectus sheath)
 - Optimal suture closer method?
- 5-7mm bites with absorbable suture Quick Hits
- Junction of semilunaris and arcuate line?
 - Spigelian hernia → intramuscular hernia
- Appendix in inguinal hernia sac?
 - Amyand hernia, primary repair in appendicitis
- Meckel’s diverticulum in inguinal hernia?
 - Littre’s hernia
- Both indirect and direct hernia?
 - Pantaloon hernia
- Sliding hernia?
 - Retroperitoneal structure makes up a portion of the sac
 - Do not open sac with a sliding hernia
- Richter’s hernia
 - Part of the wall of the bowel is present in the hernia sac
 - Strangulation without obstruction
- Doing inguinal hernia repair and skeletonized cord and can’t find hernia?
 - Need to open floor and look for femoral hernia

- Child’s C cirrhotic with massive ascites and umbilical hernia with intermittent obstructive symptoms?
 - TIPS first to control ascites before considering repair
- Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair and tack mesh to cooper’s ligament and get large arterial bleeding?
 - Corona mortis (branch between obturator and external iliac artery)
- Placing suture during open inguinal hernia repair and get sudden bleeding?
 - Femoral vein injury, pull suture out and hold pressure
- Groin pain/significant medial thigh pain with internal rotation of the hip?
 - Obturator hernia
 - Obturator sign/Howship Romberg sign
- One-month s/p open inguinal hernia repair with prolene mesh and now have wound infection with purulent fluid around mesh?
 - Mesh explantation
- Inguinal hernia repair and can’t reduce sac
 - Ligate proximal portion that will reduce into abdominal cavity
 - Keep distal portion open to reduce chances of hydrocele

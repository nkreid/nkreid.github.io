# Preface

- These outlines are the culmination of notes we have compiled over the years in our own preparation for the ABSITE . They are also the basis for the BTK podcast ABSITE review series . As such, they are intended to serve as a companion study aid to the podcast series .
- We have done our best to ensure the accuracy of the information within the outlines as well as the podcast . However, we cannot guarantee you will pass your boards solely with the information provided here, nor is this review intended for direct clinical use or a substitute for clinical competency . Why BTK Board Review?
- We know how to study for this test, and we know what it takes to do well . We are sharing with you our notes from over the years .
- Our review is approachable, concise, and convenient . It is clinically based and more up to date with current guidelines when compared to other reviews on the market .
- It is effective to learn via different formats and repetition is key . This review rounds out what’s already available and augments what we discuss in the audio review . What This Review Is:
- A thorough review of current clinical management guidelines for the most commonly tested surgical topics .
- Designed to be reviewed multiple times in order to:
 - Help you score well on the ABSITE .

 - Help you pass the general surgery Qualifying Exam and Certifying Exam .
 - Help you prepare for clerkships, rotations, and daily rounds . What This Review Isn’t:
- This is not surgical trivia - Most currently available study guides are heavy in basic science minutia . We are not going to tell you the components of the coagulation cascade . We are going to focus on key components of clinical management of surgical disease based on current guideline . This is the direction the general surgery boards are going, and there is less and less basic science showing up on the ABSITE and the boards .
 - Other review books will tell you that the APC gene is on chromosome 5, but will they tell you what the current guidelines say regarding the surgical management of the axilla with node positive breast CA? Probably not, but we will .
- This is not an exhaustive study guide . This is simply what we view as the most distilled down, high yield, need to know information for the ABSITE and the general surgery boards . How We Recommend You Prepare For The Boards:
- Study year round - Strive to be excellent at your job - Dominate each day. There is no replacement for this. You can’t slack all year and expect to dominate the ABSITE/Boards .
- That being said - it’s a test and there is gamesmanship to doing well on it . Many excellent residents and surgeons struggle with the boards . So, being smart and good at your job isn’t enough. This is where our review can help.
- Start dedicated ABSITE/Board studying at least 4-6 weeks prior to the test. Things you’ll need:
 - A Q bank (Several options available) - Do at least 1000 Q’s (minimum) - Take notes as you go through questions
- Review your notes and then re-do the questions you got wrong
 - BTK ABSITE review - Listen and Re-listen - Listen actively

(try to anticipate the answer before we tell you)
 - BTK written review - Use it as a companion to the podcast to reinforce your knowledge .
- Get rest the night before, take snacks, relax, and … DOMINATE THE DAY!!! We hope you enjoy this new edition with illustrations, tables, and finally a print option!

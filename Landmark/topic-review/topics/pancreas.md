Acute Pancreatitis
- Most common causes = ETOH, Gallstones
- Gallstone pancreatitis: Clear the duct (ERCP vs IOC) → cholecystectomy during same admission <4 weeks >4 weeks Non-necrotizing Acute peri- pancreatic fluid collection Pseudocyst Necrotizing Acute necrotic collection Walled off necrosis (you WON an operation) Table 1 - Revised Atlanta Classification for post pancreatitis fluid collections
- Necrotizing pancreatitis
 - Antibiotics?
- No for pancreatitis
- No for necrotizing pancreatitis
- Yes, for necrotizing pancreatitis with signs of infection
- Clinical signs: fever, elevated WBC
- CT guided FNA with organisms
- Imipenem is antibiotic of choice
 - Step-up approach — Answer for infected pancreatic necrosis used to be immediate OR for open debridement — 2010 JAMA article showed improved outcomes with delayed OR with “step-up” approach

Figure 1: Step-Up Approach for Infected Pancreatic Necrosis Chronic Pancreatitis
- Secondary to longstanding ETOH abuse, biliary tract disease, autoimmune, or idiopathic
- What are the symptoms of chronic pancreatitis?
 - Persistent abdominal pain, weight loss, pancreatic insufficiency (malabsorption, steatorrhea, diabetes) with hx of one or more bouts of pancreatitis
- What is the preferred imaging and findings?
 - CT can confirm diagnosis - demonstrates fibrosis, atrophy, and calcification of the gland
- Chronic pancreatitis increases risk of pancreatic cancer
- Non-operative management — pain control, nutritional management, abstaining from ETOH, pancreatic enzyme replacement

- Two main categories of operations for chronic pancreatitis: Decompress obstructed ductal system and resection of diseased tissue (Or combination of both) — several variations and very complex topic but main operations for the ABSITE are:
 - Puestow Procedure — Longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy
 - Beger Procedure — Resection of pancreatic head up to wall of duodenum with either end to end or side to side pancreaticojejunostomy (Duodenum preserving pancreatic head resection)
 - Frey Procedure — Lateral longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy with an excavation of the pancreatic head (Core out head of pancreas but avoid pancreatic transection required of Beger procedure)
- Operative intervention depends on particular morphology of disease
 - For dilated pancreatic duct (6mm or greater) would go with Peustow, so long as pancreatic head is normal
 - If pancreatic head dominant disease with or without duct dilation → Frey procedure
 - If distal pancreatic duct stricture with side branch changes and normal pancreatic head → distal pancreatectomy
 - Minimal change pancreatitis → Resection and/or drainage will not help → denervation operation (bilateral thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy) Pseudocyst
- More common with chronic pancreatitis, however, can occur after acute pancreatitis
- Most will resolve spontaneously → manage expectantly for at least 6 weeks (ideally 3mo) . Most will resolve in this time period, wait time also allows wall to mature . Consider intervention if >6cm or symptomatic .
- Often associated with pancreatic duct abnormality → Need ERCP or MRCP prior to intervention

 - Available approaches include transpapillary endoscopic stenting, endoscopic transluminal drainage, open cystgastrostomy, laparoscopic cystgastrostomy
 - How I would answer: If given a patient with persistent abdominal pain following pancreatitis and contained fluid collection on CT → Image ductal system FIRST (ERCP or MRCP), then if it’s been at least 6 weeks open or lap cystgastrostomy . Cystic Neoplasms of the Pancreas
- Many found incidentally on abdominal CTs done for other reasons → MRCP will provide better characterization and duct anatomy .
 - EUS is helpful as well and allows for aspiration for cyst fluid analysis (CEA and Amylase)
- Management based on cyst characteristics and patient symptoms
 - CEA >192 c/w mucinous cyst
 - High amylase indicates ductal communication (pseudocyst or IPMN)
- Serous cystadenoma
 - Predominantly benign
 - Well circumscribed with characteristic central stellate scar on imaging
 - Low CEA
 - Resect only if symptomatic or growing on serial imaging
- Mucinous cystic neoplams (MCN)
 - One of two mucinous lesions of the pancreas (along with IPMN)
 - Have malignant potential
 - Elevated CEA on FNA
 - Radiographically: thick walled, single cyst with internal septations
 - All MCNs should be resected in fit patients

- Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm (IPMN)
 - Classification: Main Duct IPMN and Branch Duct IPMN (Mixed type managed like MD)
 - Main Duct IPMN — higher risk of malignancy than BD-IPMN
- Endoscopic visualization of mucin secreting from a patulous “fish mouth” papilla is pathognomonic for MD IPMN
- Surgical resection is recommended for all main duct and mixed type IPMNs
 - Branch Duct IPMN — lower risk of malignancy than MD- IPMN
- Management based on Fukuoka guidelines
- Decision to resect based on fitness of patient for surgery, risk tolerance of patient, and individual cyst characteristics
- Consider resection for:
 - “Worrisome Features” — cyst size >3cm, thickened cyst wall, nonenhancing mural nodules, lyphadenopathy, MPD >10mm, abrupt change in MPD size with distal atrophy
 - EUS with mural nodules, main duct involvement, or suspicious cytology
 - Young patient with cyst >2cm owing to cumulative risk of malignancy
- Age can indicate likely lesion
 - Daughter → solid pseudopapillary
 - Mother → mucinous
 - Grandmother → serous

Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Pancreas (PNETs) Figure 2: PNET Distribution
- Comprise 1-2% of pancreatic tumors
- Frequently non-functional, but can also elaborate a number of bioactive peptides (gastrin, glucagon, somatostatin, insulin, VIP)
- If functional, clinical presentation is characteristic of hormone elaborated
- Nonfunctional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor
 - Majority (60-90%) of nonfunctional PNETs are malignant
 - Most discovered late due to asymptomatic nature . Can be discovered incidentally or 2/2 symptoms from mass effect - Generally large at time of discovery with high metastasis rate
 - MC in head of pancreas
- Tumors IN the head of the pancreas: insulINoma, gastrINoma, somatostatINoma
 - Patients with locoregional disease should undergo resection

- Insulinoma
 - Most common functional PNET
 - Insulin secreted by beta-cells
 - Most are benign (90%)
 - Located throughout pancreas
 - Associated with “Whipple Triad”
- Fasting hypoglycemia
- Neuroglycopenic symptoms (confusion, combativeness, seizures, visual changes, loss of consciousness)
- Relief of symptoms with administration of glucose
 - Biochemical diagnosis and confirmation tests - If meet the below criteria, localization studies should be done
- Symptoms with plasma glucose <55mg/dL
- Insulin >18pmol/L
- C-peptide > 0 .6 ng/mL
- Proinsulin > 5 pg/mL
- Beta-hydroxybutyrate < 2 .7mmol/L
- An increase in plasma glucose of at least 25 mg/dL after administration of glucagon
 - Localization studies
- 1 - Triphasic CT or MRI
- 2 - Endoscopic US
- 3 - If above unable to localize → Selective intra-arterial calcium injection with hepatic venous sampling for insulin
- Somatostatin scintigraphy is NOT effective
 - Treatment
- Depends on location, suspicion for malignancy, and presence of other tumors
- Solitary, benign appearing tumors can be treated with enucleation
- Distal tumors may be treated with distal spleen preserving pancreatectomy
- Suspicion for malignancy requires formal resection

- Gastrinoma
 - Gastrin stimulates acid secretion from parietal cells
 - Mostly malignant (60-90%)
 - 2/3rd are located in Gastrinoma Triangle, a triangle formed by:
- Junction of the cystic duct and CBD
- Junction of the 2nd and 3rd portions of the duodenum
- Junction of the neck and body of the pancreas
 - Associated with classic triad (abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss) in the presence of PUD
 - Diagnostic and confirmatory tests
- Elevated fasting serum gastrin level - must be with a low gastric pH or high basal acid output (as use of PPI or H2 blockers will raise gastrin levels)
- Fasting gastrin level >1000 pg/mL is diagnostic
- Elevated levels <1000 pg/mL → secretin stimulation test
 - Gastrinoma will have a paradoxical effect from secretin (Increase >200 pg/mL with administration of secretin is diagnostic)
- Localization studies
 - 1 . Triphasic CT or MRI
 - 2 . Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS)
 - 3 . EUS
 - 4 . Possible selective intra-arterial calcium injection with hepatic venous sampling for gastrin (institution specific)
 - Unable to localize → Exploration with the following maneuvers
- Intraoperative U/S
- Transduodenal palpation
- Intraoperative upper endoscopy with transduodenal illumination
- Duodenotomy with palpation

 - Treatment
- Tumor in duodenal mucosa → enucleation and periduodenal lymph node dissection
- Noninvasive tumors 5cm or smaller in head of pancreas → enucleation with periduodenal lymph node dissection
- Tumors >5cm or invasive in head of pancreas → Whipple
- Tumor in body and tail → distal pancreatectomy
- Glucagonoma
 - Glucagon secreted from alpha islet cells and acts on hepatocytes and adipose tissue to increase gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis
 - Mostly malignant (90%)
 - MC location is tail of pancreas
 - Associated with 4 D’s - dermatitis, diabetes, depression, and DVT
- DVT 2/2 a factor X-like antigen secreted by tumor
 - Characteristic skin rash = necrolytic migratory erythema
 - Diagnostic and confirmatory tests
- Glucose intolerance + fasting glucagon levels between 1,000-5,000 pg/mL
 - Localization studies
- Triphasic CT or MRI
- Somatostatin receptor Scintigraphy
- EUS
- Selective visceral angiography
 - Treatment
- Resection with regional lymphadenectomy (no enucleation due to high malignant potential
- Usually distal pancreatectomy

- What else is needed?
 - Cholecystectomy (d/t possible need for prolonged somatostatin therapy)
- Somatostatinoma
 - Somatostatin has a broad spectrum of inhibitory activity in the GI tract
 - Mostly malignant
 - MC location is head of pancreas (duodenal location also common)
 - Associated with cholecystitis, DM, malabsorption, steatorrhea
 - Localization studies
- Triphasic CT or MRI
- Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy
- EUS
- Selective arteriography
 - Treatment
- Resection with regional lymphadenectomy (No enucleation due to high malignant potential)
- AND…?
- Cholecystectomy
- VIPoma
 - VIP is neuropeptide that stimulates secretion of fluids and electrolytes into lumen, also inhibits gastric acid secretion
 - Mostly malignant
 - MC location is body or tail of pancreas (extra-pancreatic locations also possible: adrenal, retroperitoneum, mediastinum)
 - Associated with WDHA syndrome (watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, achlorhydria)
 - Diagnostic tests
- Elevated fasting VIP levels when diarrhea is present

 - Localization studies
- Triphasic CT of MRI
- Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy
- EUS
- Selective arteriography
 - Treatment
- Resection with regional lymphadenectomy (no enucleation due to high malignant potential
- AND???
- Cholecystectomy (d/t possibly need for prolonged somatostatin therapy) Table 21: High-Yield PNET Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
- Risk factors: cigarette smoking, heavy ETOH use, chronic pancreatitis, increased BMI, longstanding DM
- Imaging
 - Pancreatic protocol CT
 - EUS can be complimentary to CT in patients with questionable involvement of lymph nodes or blood vessels
 - PET/CT used selectively if suspicion for metastasis
- Role of staging laparoscopy? - Controversial . Used routinely by some, selectively by others only in patients at high risk for disseminated disease (borderline resectable, high CA 19-9, large primary tumor, large regional nodes, highly symptomatic)
- Biopsy?
 - Pathologic diagnosis NOT required prior to resection
 - Needed prior to neoadjuvant therapy or if unresectable, prior

to definitive chemotherapy
- Role of preoperative biliary drainage?
 - No effect on survival; associated with increased wound infections rates
 - For resectable disease and not undergoing neoadjuvant therapy → Consider only if significant pruritis, cholangitis, coagulopathic .
 - For patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy → drain if jaundiced
 - What kind of stent?
- Self-expanding metal stents are preferred because they are easy to place without dilation, have longer patency than plastic stents, and do not interfere with resection
- Resectability
 - Resectable
- No arterial tumor contact
- <180-degree contact with SMV or PV without vein contour irregularity
 - Borderline Resectable
- Tumor contact with SMA or celiac <180 degrees
- Tumor contact with common hepatic only (no celiac or proper hepatic involvement) allowing for resection and reconstruction
- Involvement of SMV or PV that is amenable to resection and reconstruction
- Tumor contact with IVC
 - Unresectable
- Distant metastasis
- >180-degree contact with SMA or celiac
- Unreconstructable involvement of SMV or PV
- Treatment
 - Primary Surgery

- Distal tumors present late and are usually too advanced at time of diagnosis for resection → Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy if resectable
- Head of pancreas tumor → pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure)
- If found to be unresectable at time of operation → consider palliative biliary bypass, gastrojejunostomy, and/ or celiac plexus neurolysis depending on individual tumor characteristics and patient symptoms
- In absence of frank venous occlusion PV or SMV resection and reconstruction may be performed in order to obtain R0 resection
 - Perioperative therapy
- Recurrence rates are high, even with R0 resection → Everyone gets adjuvant therapy
- FOLFIRINOX (FOLinic acid, Fluorouricil, IRINotecan, OXaliplatin)
- Neoadjuvant chemoradiation should be considered for those with borderline resectable disease (requires EUS with FNA for pathologic confirmation first) Quick Hits
- Patient with history of multiple episodes of pancreatitis now presents with hematemesis . Diagnosis and management?
 - Gastric varices from splenic vein thrombosis
 - Treatment = Splenectomy
- Patient with multiple branch duct IPMNs on imaging . There are multiple small benign appearing cysts throughout proximal pancreatic body with larger dominant one more distally with worrisome features . Management?
 - Resect distal lesion, okay to leave smaller benign ones behind but will need surveillance
- 48-year-old patient incidentally diagnosed with 2cm branch chain IPMN on abdominal CT . Microcytic anemia noted on laboratory w/u . What else does he/she need as part of work up?
 - Colonoscopy — IPMN patients have higher incidence of

extra-pancreatic malignancies (MC - Colon adenocarcinoma)
- Syndromes associated with PNETs?
 - MEN I
- Usually multiple PNETs - can be functional or non- functional
- MC pancreatic tumor?
 - Nonfunctional
- MC functional tumor?
 - Gastrinoma
- Patient presents with episodes of fasting hypoglycemia and dizziness that resolves with glucose administration . C-peptide is checked and is low . Diagnosis?
 - Exogenous (factitious) insulin administration
- Medical management of functional neuroendocrine tumors of pancreas?
 - Octreotide; except for…Insulinoma
- Somatic mutations associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma?
 - KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4
- Biomarkers associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma?
 - Many, but CA 19-9 is best validated and most clinically useful
- During pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, a clinically positive lymph node is encountered outside the field of resection. Should you:
 - A . Leave it alone
 - B . Perform regional lymphadenectomy
 - C . Sample the node but not perform complete regional lymphadenectomy
- Answer = C . Nodal metastasis are a marker of systemic disease and removal is unlikely to alter overall survival . Outside of a clinical trial a regional lymphadenectomy should not be performed during Whipple procedure .

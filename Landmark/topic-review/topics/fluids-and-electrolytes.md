16 FLUIDS AND ELECTROLYTES

- What is the percentage of total body water by weight in an adult? What percent of total body water is intracellular?
 - Body weight in Kg x 0 .6 = L of water
 - 2/3rds is intracellular
- If 1/3rd of our total body water is extracellular, what percentage of that is intravascular?
 - ¼ is intravascular
 - ¾ is extravascular
- What is blood volume of 70 kg male?
 - 5 L
 - 7% by body weight
 - In pediatric it is 80 cc/kg
- What are our common maintenance fluids?
 - D5 ½ NS + 20 Meq of K
 - D5 ¼ NS in babies
- Resuscitative fluids?
 - Balanced crystalloid (LR or NS)
 - Colloids
- Electrolyte concentrations of NS and LR in 1L
 - NS = 154 mEq of Na and Cl
 - LR = 130 mEq sodium, 4 mEq potassium, 2.7 mEq calcium, 109 mEq chloride and 28 mEq of HCO3
- Maintenance fluids
 - 4, 2, 1 rule = hourly rate
 - 4 cc/kg for first 10 kg, 2 cc/kg for second 10, every 1 cc for every kg over 20 kg
 - Simplified version(for adults) = weight in kg + 40 = hourly rate of fluids

- How much sodium does a person need a day?
 - 1-2 mEq/kg
 - 70 kg person = 70-140 mEq/day
- How much potassium does a person need a day?
 - 0.5 -1 mEq/kg
 - 70 kg person = 35-70 mEq/day
- When to use D5 ½ NS?
 - Patients that are NPO
 - Protein sparing for fasting patients
 - D5 = 5% per liter = 50 Grams
 - 50 Grams x 3 .4 kcal = 170 kcals per liter of D5 saline solution
- What fluid do you give to someone that has been copiously vomiting?
 - Resuscitative fluids (no D5), generally NS
 - 1 L at a time to see if they respond
 - ¼ of it stays intravascular
- How do colloids increase intravascular volume?
 - Oncotic pressure in vessel that draws fluids intravascular
 - Concern in sepsis/trauma/burns is with increased capillary permeability is colloid will leak out to interstitial space and draw fluid with it
- What colloids are available?
 - Albumin
 - Plasmanate
 - Hetastarch, Hespand
- Side effects of coagulopathy
- Negatively effects platelet function
- Also can cause acute kidney injury

- What increases insensible losses?
 - Burns
 - Fevers
 - Ventilators
 - Open abdomen

- What fluid do you replace with?
 - High NG tube output
- Normal Saline
 - High volume bile leak (lose bicarb in bile)
- LR or D5 solution with bicarb
 - Patient with diarrhea (lose K for colon)
- LR or NS with K
- Patient 2 days s/p open procedure now hyponatremic what are possibilities?
 - Excess free water
 - SIADH
 - Pseudohyponatermia due to hyperglycemia or other high protein state
 - How to differentiate
 - Determine measured serum osmoles and calculated serum osmoles
 - Serum osmolality is calculated by looking at chemistry
- Na, Glucose and BUN
- (2 x Na) + Glucose/18 + BUN/2 .8
- Simplified (Na x 2) + 10
- Compare to urine osmolality
- If it is SIADH your serum osmolality will be less than urine (very concentrated urine)
- If it is excess free water urine osmolality will be very low (trying to excrete excess water)

 - If it is excess free water how do you treat?
- Fluid restriction
 - If it is SIADH?
- Fluid restriction
- Give NS (don’t correct sodium too quickly, no more than 1 mEq/hour)
- Vaptans (vasopressin antagonist)
- Demeclocycline
- How to determine sodium deficit?
 - Desired sodium - actual sodium x TBW = Sodium deficit in mEq
- Primary causes of hypernatremia?
 - Iatrogenic
 - Diabetes insipidus
 - Pt with head injury and urine output increases to 700 cc/hr and now hypernatremic how to confirm its DI?
- Compare serum osmolality to urine osmolality
- Serum osmolality will be high and urine will be low in DI
 - How to treat DI?
- Desmopressin (DDAVP)
 - How to calculate free water deficit
- (Actual Na - Desired Na)/ Desired Na x TBW = Volume in liters
- What is hypophosphatemia associated with?
 - Refeeding syndrome due to P04 shift extracellular to intracellular
 - Can lead to failure to wean from ventilator
- How do you manage patient with hyperkalemia?
 - Likely renal failure, could be medication induced
 - EKG looking for peaked T waves

 - Treatment
- Give calcium to stabilize myocardium
- NaHCO3
- Glucose with IV Insulin
- Lasix
- Kayexalate
- Albuterol
- Emergent Dialysis
- How to treat hypokalemia?
 - Causes - Iatrogenic such as over diuresis
 - 40 mEq of K should increase total K 0.4
- Hypocalcemia symptoms
 - Weakness
 - Perioral Tingling
 - Chovstek’s sign - tap on facial nerve and get perioral twitching
 - Trousseau’s sign - Carpal pedal spasm with blood pressure cuff
- Treatment of hypocalcemia?
 - IV Calcium
 - Vit D and Mg
- If hypocalcemia patient has low serum albumin, how do we correct serum calcium?
 - Normal Albumin = 4
 - Every point below 4 add 0 .8 to calcium level
 - If Albumin = 2, add 1 .6 to serum calcium level
- What are main causes of hypercalcemia?
 - MC cause of hypercalcemia in outpatient = hyperparathyroidism
 - MC cause of hypercalcemia in an inpatient = malignancy

- Symptoms of hypercalcemia?
 - Stones, bones, groans, and psychiatric overtones
 - Kidney stones, bone pain, abdominal pain, and psychosis
- Treatment of hypercalcemia?
 - Crystalloid resuscitation
 - Loop diuretic second line
 - Bisphosphonates are helpful for hypercalcemia due to cancer
 - Calcitonin
 - Glucocorticoids
 - Dialysis
- Most important parts of ABG?
 - pCO2, Bicarb, Base Excess/Base Deficit
- Normal values of ABG (to remember for exam)
 - pCO2 = 40
 - pH = 7 .4
 - Bicarb = 24
- A change in pCO2 what change in pH would you expect?
 - 0.8 x DCO2 = DpH for acute changes
 - pH change by .1 for every 12 point change in CO2
- Dr . Matthew Martin Tips When Looking at ABG
 - Looks at CO2 first
- If high writes resp acidosis . If low, writes resp alkalosis
 - Then looks at bicarb
- If high, writes metabolic alkalosis . If low, writes metabolic acidosis
 - Then he looks at pH and their history to put it all together

- Metabolic acidosis
 - Start with calculating anion gap
 - (Na + K) - (Cl + HCO3)
 - Gap Acidosis = MUDPILES
 - Non-Anion Gap = Ileal conduit, Fistulas, Hyperchloremic (Too much NaCL), Renal Tubular Acidosis, Diarrhea, Acetazolamide
- Metabolic alkalosis
 - NG suction - Hyperchloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis
 - Contraction alkalosis from over diuresis
- Give chloride back is most important Table 1: Common Electrolyte Abnormalities and Treatment

Acid Base Practice Problems
- Patient undergoes surgery and has 3L NG Suction, postop ABG shows 7 .55, pCO2= 52, HCO3 = 40
 - What is his primary disorder?
- He is alkalotic with a metabolic alkalosis (HCO3 of 40)
- Respiratory acidosis is compensatory
- Primary metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation
- Patient who is admitted in a coma, pCO2 = 16, HCO3 = 5, pH = 7 .1
 - Metabolic acidosis with a respiratory compensation
 - Respiratory alkalosis is compensatory as overall disorder is acidotic
- Climber climbing a mountain, he is at 5000 meters, what is his going to happen to his pCO2 and his pH?
 - pCO2 will go down and pH will go up
 - Respiratory alkalosis
- Patient whose pH is 7 .5, PCO2 = 50, HCO3 is 35
 - Primarily metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation Quick Hits
- Cation that determines serum osmolarity
 - Na
- Primary intracellular cation
 - K
- Sepsis resuscitation bolus amount cc/kg
 - 30cc/kg
- Pediatric patient who needs bolus
 - 20 cc/kg
 - Blood products = 10 cc/kg

- Pt with K of 6 .5 and peaked T waves on EKG, what medication do you give first
 - Calcium gluconate
- Pt on liver transplant list, who was started on a “water pill” by his PCP, now has K of 2 .5
 - Lasix
- Pt on liver transplant list, who was started on a “water pill” by his PCP, now his K is 5 .5
 - Spironolactone
- Pt came in hyponatremic getting 3% NS, and now they develop spastic quadriplegia

 - Hypochloremic, hypokalemic, metabolic acidosis
 - Paradoxical aciduria
- Effect of acidosis on oxygen-hemoglobin disassociation curve
 - Right shift - oxygen will unload easier
- Surgical patient gets hextend and is now bleeding in OR, what coagulation disorder do they have

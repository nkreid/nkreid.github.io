    Dear Family & Friends <br />
    Thanks for visiting!<br /> 
    I want to catch you up on my life!

  <p> I have finally graduated -- with TWO degrees. I got my bachelor of science in biophysics and master of science in biomedical engineering in a combined 5 year program, but I cant wait to start this next chapter of my life! On May 21st, I am moving out to Houston, TX to start medical school at an amazing new program called EnMed. It is a track within Texas A&M's medical school in partnership with Houston Methodist Hospital at the Texas Medical Center. I will be getting a Doctor of Medicine (MD) and Master of Engineering (M. Eng) in Biodesign within the normal 4 years of traditional medical school. Click the image to the left and watch Dr. Pettigrew tell you about the amazing new program I am starting!

  <p> Overall, my experience at USC was amazing. I started a semester late, which at first, I was upset about. In hindsight, I made the best decision! UCLA still sucks, and I feel bad my brother had to go there! I majored in Biophysics as an undergrad and I got the time to explore my interests. I wrote a blog in my writing class about the physics in science fiction movies. I can't tell you how much better this was than writing book reports on classic literature. Take a look for yourself by clicking the image to the right! I don't think I'll ever have the time to devote my full attention to studying thermodynaics or quantum mechanics, and for that I am grateful.

  <p> By far, the best memories over the last five years were with the people I met while at USC. They will be my friends for life. We took many trips, attended countless football games, and enjoyed the amazing SoCal weather. I have to be honest, I am not looking forward to the weather in Houston . . .

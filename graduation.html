  <p>As a child, I was puzzled by the hypoxic environments that caused my nausea on mountain roads and the forces required to fracture my clavicle playing football. After one introductory physics course, I could easily explain what happened, but I never felt like I had solved the problem. In hindsight, my change of major to biophysics was my subconscious gravitating back towards medicine, but I struggled to find the link between biology and physics that drew me to the name. I was not interested in the kinetics of motor proteins or chemotaxis in E. Coli â€“ I was fascinated with the human body's ability to survive. From the regulation of gases in deep-sea dives to the reduction of low gravity effects in space exploration, humans have exceeded their physiologic potential. These questions that picked my brain were interdisciplinary in nature. I was not satisfied with the answer from the physicist, the biologist, or even the physician. But the answer I pieced together from the three was exactly what I was looking for.

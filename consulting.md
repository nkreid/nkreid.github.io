### The Emerging Role of the Physician Innovator
People dream of becoming a physician, but I never thought of myself as one of them. I am passionate about medicine, and I know I want to work with patients daily, but I was scared that I would have to give up my engineering background to be a physician. As I got older, I began to see engineering in medicine prevail. I remember seeing teleconsults with neurologists in the ED and first thought it would never catch on. Two years later, the entire healthcare system moved to telemedicine in a week because of COVID-19. I realized that my interests weren’t mutually exclusive. I didn’t need to sacrifice my love for finding new solutions because I wanted to be a physician. 
 
In fact, these two fields complement each other more than they conflict. I have seen my own engineered devices work to advance research about the body and I constantly stumble upon opportunites for innovative treatments in my line of work. As an engineer, I have learned how to take existing pieces to create a new solution. Sometimes these pieces are hardware and devices; other times, the pieces are time, opportunity, and people. I started NKR Solutions in my first year of medical school to begin working with early-stage startups in the medical device field and have thrived filling the role of translator between the clinicians and engineers that suddenly must work together in their new endeavor.

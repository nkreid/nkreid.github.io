### Distance learning not going as planned?
### Need a break from your child's homework?

Lets be real, distance learning does not work for everyone. Sometimes, some extra 1-on-1 instruction is needed. I am currently working in-person and virtually with students around OC. 

I have been tutoring students for over 6 years in math and science classes from 6th grade through college. I work with students in rememdial classes, excellerated programs, and everything in between. My hours and availabilty are constantly changing so give me a call to find out more!

Most of my students meet weekly or biweekly as this is the best way to stay on track in their course. However, I do work with some families on an as needed basis.
My rates range from $30-$40/hr depending on location, grade-level, and required preparation. 

Please contact me directly for up-to-date pricing, plans, and schedules.

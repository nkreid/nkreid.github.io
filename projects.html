   <h1 class="thin">Tendon-Driven Robotics<strong></h1>
    <p class="thin">As the field of robotics advances, the further robots stray from the likeness of humans.
    Our unique species has evolved over thousands of years, yet we still have four separate 
    quadriceps muscles extending our knee. Most of society glosses over these observations as sources 
    of inspiration, but we wrestle with these ideas every day at the Brain-Body Dynamics Lab. As a young 
    undergraduate, I explored the fascinating world of tendon-driven robotics as a platform for affordable 
    prosthetics and ongoing neuromorphic research. I set out to design the most versatile design of 
    a tendon-driven arm. I defined a versatile arm to mean that it could be as strong as possible in all 
    directions. This process produced what I coined a Multi-Moment Arm (MMA) joint. Through computational
    optimization, 3D modeling, and some thoughtful tendon routes, I prototyped the most versatile two joint arm possible.

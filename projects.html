     <h1 class="thin">Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathies</h1>
      <p class="thin">Diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the world’s population. Neuropathy, a common complication of diabetes, accounts for more hospitalizations than all other complications of diabetes combined. Loss of sensation and muscle control in the legs and feet (Peripheral Neuropathy) is a subset of neuropathy that is particularly relevant to the everyday task of walking. To date, there is a lack of reliable biomarkers that capture the onset and progression of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Current work produces subjective measurements with moderate sensitivity, requires invasive and costly nerve conduction measurements, or involves complicated equipment and highly trained personnel. We aim to help maintain quality of life and inform treatment in patients with diabetes by tracking the effects of disease progression on neuromuscular control. We will do this via the Valero Dexterity Test. This test has been shown to quantify an individual’s ability to control dynamic foot-ground interactions with low forces while safely seated. These dynamic foot-ground interactions rely on sensorimotor processing to successfully use the feet while walking. If the data supports our hypothesis, this may serve as a novel biomarker to objectively quantify DPN safely and simply in the outpatient clinic. In particular, such a test is directly relevant to functional gait measures as a biomarker for daily living activities and risk of falls. Additionally, it can guide rehabilitation to avoid wound healing complications after surgical repair of necrotic defects on the legs and feet. This project is currently collecting data at USC.

     <h1 class="thin">Neruomuscular control after Stroke</h1>
      <p class="thin">There are many possible explanations for the redundant muscular actuation of our bodies, and the control of this system is currently a hot topic in neuroscience. For example, we have four quadriceps muscles with the singular task of extending our knee. Why four, and not one, two, or eight? Unfortunately, our number of quadriceps is not fully customizable yet, so we are stuck with four. This structure turns our attention to the difficult task of using four muscles to accomplish one task, or in other parts of the body, using two muscles to perform three tasks. Imagine having four gas pedals in your car, each responsible for a separate wheel. Our idea of driving would be much more complicated considering that wheels spin at different speeds on turns. This is the problem our brain has to confront millions of times a day. As expected, the complex neuropathways that drive our muscles are often the most vulnerable to disruption after a stroke. While participating in a team studying this control of the upper extremity, I was amazed by my team’s crude prototype. I first redesigned the system to be sleek, portable, and user-friendly. I am currently using this new device to continue investigating motor control in stroke participants alongside age-matched healthy participants.

     <h1 class="thin">Returning to Sports after ACL Surgery</h1>
      <p class="thin">We all know somebody with a bad knee. It might be your elderly neighbor who has been wearing them down for years or even your teenage sister that ruined hers on the soccer field. Soccer has the highest incident of ACL injury, right up there with lacrosse, basketball, and football. Ask any engineer, and they will surely recognize the mechanically unstable structure of the knee. There is ongoing research answering how our bodies stabilize a notoriously unstable joint like the knee. Others are exploring more elusive questions like why female athletes are almost eight times more likely to injure their ACL when compared with the opposite sex. I jumped onto a fascinating project at USC that is attempting to quantify the recovery after ACL surgery. Our goal is to eliminate the subjective, blanket treatment plans for all ACL recoveries. With quantitative data, we hope to eradicate redundant PT appointments for those making speedy recoveries while providing strong support for patients who need the extra sessions that insurance is hesitant to cover. Medical knowledge is exploding, and with it, a new era of personalized, data-driven treatments is on the horizon.

     <h1 class="thin">Tendon-Driven Robotics</h1>
      <p class="thin">As the field of robotics advances, the further robots stray from the likeness of humans.
        Our unique species has evolved over thousands of years, yet we still have four separate quadriceps muscles extending our knee. Most of society glosses over these observations as sources of inspiration, but we wrestle with these ideas every day at the Brain-Body Dynamics Lab. As a young undergraduate, I explored the fascinating world of tendon-driven robotics as a platform for affordable prosthetics and ongoing neuromorphic research. I set out to design the most versatile design of  a tendon-driven arm. I defined a versatile arm to mean that it could be as strong as possible in all directions. This process produced what I coined a Multi-Moment Arm (MMA) joint. Through computational optimization, 3D modeling, and some thoughtful tendon routes, I prototyped the most versatile two joint arm possible.

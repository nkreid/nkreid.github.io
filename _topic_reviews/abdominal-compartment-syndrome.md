difficulty: "Advanced"
attending_notes: "Dr. Murphy expects rapid recognition of ACS triggers and escalation steps."
time_goal: "15-minute rapid review"
high_yield_pearls:
  - "Suspect ACS in any patient with rising ventilator pressures, oliguria, and tense abdomen."
  - "Measure bladder pressure every 4 hours when IAP risk factors accumulate."
  - "Decompress early when intra-abdominal pressure remains > 20 mmHg with new organ dysfunction."
workflow_steps:
  - "Screen for risk factors: massive resuscitation, burns, pancreatitis, trauma."
  - "Perform focused exam and trend ventilator, UOP, and lactate data."
  - "Obtain baseline bladder pressure and optimize sedation/neuromuscular blockade."
  - "Initiate medical decompression: NG/rectal tubes, prokinetics, diuretics."
  - "Optimize abdominal wall compliance with analgesia and repositioning."
  - "Escalate to percutaneous drainage when tense ascites or hemoperitoneum is present."
  - "Coordinate OR decompressive laparotomy if IAP > 25 mmHg with organ failure."
  - "Pack viscera, place negative pressure dressing, and chart temporary closure plan."
  - "Resuscitate to maintain perfusion: balanced transfusion, avoid over-resuscitation."
  - "Plan staged closure and monitor for recurrent ACS in the ICU."
pimp_questions:
  - question: "What threshold defines intra-abdominal hypertension?"
    answer: ">= 12 mmHg of sustained intra-abdominal pressure."
  - question: "How do you calculate abdominal perfusion pressure?"
    answer: "Mean arterial pressure minus intra-abdominal pressure; goal > 60 mmHg."
  - question: "Name three temporizing measures before decompressive laparotomy."
    answer: "Paralysis, nasogastric decompression, and percutaneous drainage of fluid collections."

## Quick Reference Narrative

Use this summary to rehearse the pathophysiology, recognition, and staged management of abdominal compartment syndrome before rounds or call nights.

## Expanded Notes

- Watch for fluid creep in massive transfusion patients and titrate balanced resuscitation strategies.
- Coordinate with critical care early when bladder pressures begin to climb to 12 mmHg.
- After decompression, reassess ventilator mechanics, renal perfusion, and abdominal perfusion pressure every hour.

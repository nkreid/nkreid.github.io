# ABSITE Companion (Jekyll-Ready)

These Markdown files are prepped for your Jekyll layout. Each file includes:

- `layout: landmark` in the front matter
- `permalink: /absite/<slug>/` for clean URLs
- Side TOC auto-built by your layout's JS from H2/H3 headings
- Images referenced from `images/`

## Install

1. Save your provided HTML as `_layouts/landmark.html` in your Jekyll repo.
2. Copy this entire folder (`*.md` and `images/`) into your site (e.g., `/absite/` root or `_posts`-adjacent).
3. Commit and push to GitHub Pages.

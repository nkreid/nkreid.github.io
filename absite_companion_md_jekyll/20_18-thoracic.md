18 THORACIC
High Yield Anatomy
•	 How many lobes on the right vs left?
o 3 vs 2 anatomic lobes
•	 What is a good way to remember the lymph node stations?
o Single digits are mediastinal vs double digits are hilar
•	 What is the full course of the thoracic duct?
o Cisterna chyli (L2)  crosses at T5 from right to left  
empties into junction of L internal jugular and subclavian 
veins
o What is the final destination of the azygous?
• Superior vena cava
Where do you find the duck (thoracic duct)?
Between the two goose – azyGOOSE vein and 
esophaGOOSE
•	 Where do the nerves run in relation to the hilum of the lung?
o Phrenic nerve is anterior
o oVagus nerve runs posterior
Think alphabetical order: A (anterior) before P (posterior)
P (phrenic)  anterior comes before V (vagus)  
posterior
•	 What are the anatomic boundaries of the mediastinum?
o Sternum anteriorly, vertebrae posteriorly, pleurae laterally, 
thoracic inlet superiorly, diaphragm inferiorly
•	 What are the types of pneumocytes and their function?
o Type 1 = gas exchange
o Type 2 = makes surfactant (phosphatidylcholine is the 
primary component)
•	 What are the pores of Kahn?
o Pores in alveoli that enable direct air exchange

Space of Disse is the hepatic analog: hepatocytes interact 
directly with the sinusoids
Functional Definitions
o Pulmonary Function Tests
• What is the pre-op workup of a patient you are considering 
for lobectomy?
• Predicted forced expiratory volume FEV1 > 0 .8 (80%)
o If close  V/Q scan will show contribution of the 
diseased lung
• FEV1 is the best predictor of post op complications . 
What else is predictive of increased perioperative risk?
o Diffusion capacity of the lung for CO2 or DLCO < 
10 mL/min/mm (40% predicted)
o What is Light’s criteria?
• Characterize pleural fluid as exudate vs transudate
• Pleural:serum protein ratio > 0 .5
• Pleural:serum LDH ratio > 0 .6
• Pleural LDH > 2/3 of normal serum LDH
Pleural disease
•	 Pleural effusion and Empyema
o What causes these?
• Increased permeability of the pleura and capillaries 
(sepsis, malignancy, pancreatitis)
• Increased hydrostatic pressure (CHF, CKD)
• Hypoalbuminemia (cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, 
malnutrition)
o What type of imaging should you get and what would you 
see?
• CXR = blunting of costophrenic angle, visible effusion if > 
300 mL, fluid in fissures

• US = fluid in the pleural space with loss of inspiratory 
sliding
• CT chest = simple effusion will be homogeneous, most 
are posterior and inferior vs an empyema would be a 
loculated, heterogeneous collection
o Treatment?
• Pleural effusion  conservative management, treat 
underlying cause, unless symptomatic then drain
• Empyema  decortication
•	 How do you manage a retained hemothorax?
o Chest tube  VATS or thoracotomy for washout
•	 Chylothorax
o How do you diagnose it?
• Milky white fluid
• > 110 mg/dL triglycerides with lymphocyte predominance
• Sudan red stains fat and will be positive
o What are the most common etiologies?
• 50% are due to malignancy (lymphoma)
• What causes the other 50%?
• Trauma or iatrogenic
• When do symptoms begin after iatrogenic injury?
o After initiation of oral intake
o What is the management?
• First-line is conservative management with low fat, 
medium-chain fatty acid diet (no long-chain FAs) or bowel 
rest with TPN if high-volume or persistent leak on the oral 
diet, chest tube if necessary, +/- octreotide
• If fails or due to traumatic injury  ligation of thoracic duct 
in low right mediastinum vs talc pleurodesis and possible 
chemoradiation for malignancy

18 THORACIC
What does he likely have?
o Spontaneous pneumothorax due to apical subpleural blebs
o What is the difference between primary and secondary PTX?
• Secondary is due to an underlying medical condition . 
Examples?
• COPD most common, asthma, CF, infection, 
malignancy, connective tissue disease, congenital 
cysts, etc .
o ED confirmed PTX on CXR and intern goes down to see. At 
this point he looks anxious, working a bit to breathe, HR 120, 
RR 30, BP 90/50, with a prominent neck vein . What does he 
have?
• Tension pneumothorax - if the intern isn’t too far into 
surgical residency, he/she probably took a stethoscope 
and heard an absence of breath sounds on the affected 
side
• What is the first step in managing this?
• Needle decompression
• How would you do that?
o Insert a needle, angiocaths are readily available, 
into the second intercostal space at a 90-degree 
angle to the chest, just over the third rib .
• In reality, we would place a chest tube which would be 
just as quick
o Back to non-tension PTX . How do you manage these?
• For clinically stable with small PTX  observe
• For clinically stable with large (> 3 cm)  pigtail catheter 
or chest tube
• For unstable and large  chest tube
• When do you operate?
• Persistent air leak (> 4 days)  VATS with pleurodesis
• After second recurrence of spontaneous/primary  
blebectomy
• High-risk profession after first occurrence (scuba diver, 
pilot)

Spontaneous pneumothorax in the OR, don’t see blebs. 
What do you do? Apical wedge resection
•	 How do you perform a pleurodesis?
• Can do mechanical with scratch pad, bovie, etc .
• Chemical = doxycycline, bleomycin, talc
• Pleurectomy
• Indwelling intrapleural catheter
• Goal is to abut the visceral and parietal pleura by causing 
an inflammatory reaction that scars them together
Mediastinal disease
o 60-year-old alcoholic went on a binge and had massive, 
forceful emesis . Comes to the ED with chest pain, fever, 
tachycardia . CXR unremarkable . Next step?
• Worried about esophageal perforation so gastrografin 
swallow; also need to see extent of mediastinitis  CT 
neck/chest with PO and IV contrast
• Acute mediastinitis usually due to acute perforation 
of esophagus or trachea and can lead to descending 
necrotizing infection  sepsis
• Can also be caused by oropharyngeal infections 
(Ludwig angina)
• Chronic mediastinitis usually manifests as fibrosis
• How do you manage acute mediastinal infection?
• Source control, antibiotics  sternal debridement 
if postop sternotomy is the etiology, cervical drain if 
cervical infection, VATS to drain mediastinum into 
pleural space if lower mediastinal infection
o Mediastinal tumors
• Most common cause of mediastinal adenopathy?
• Lymphoma
• Most common overall type of mediastinal tumor in adults 
and children?

cancer most common, then lymphoma
• Nonmalignant = fibrosing mediastinits, substernal 
thyroid goiter, sarcoid, etc ., secondary to indwelling 
intravascular devices
• How do they present?
• Venous obstructive symptoms with dilation of head 
and neck veins and facial, neck, or arm swelling; can 
get laryngeal and tracheobronchial compression
• Fullness in the head when bending over
• Can be associated with Horner syndrome if due to a 
pancoast tumor = ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis

no further work up
o Is the surgical risk acceptable? If no, consider 
biopsy for diagnosis and radiation for palliation if 
necessary
o If growing over 2 years but acceptable surgical 
risk, consider clinical probability of cancer
• Low  serial CT at 3, 6, 12, 24 months
• Intermediate  PET/CT, transthoracic or 
bronchoscopic biopsy
• High  VATS biopsy with frozen section and 
then lobectomy if malignant

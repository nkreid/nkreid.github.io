11 VASCULAR
Carotid/Vertebral
•	 What are the structures of the carotid sheath?
o Carotid Artery
o Internal Jugular Vein
o Vagus Nerve
•	 What are the segments of the vertebral artery?
o V1 - Origin off subclavian to foramina of C6
o V2 (Foraminal) - From the transverse foramen of C2-C6
o V3 - From C2 to Dura
o V4 – Intracranial
•	 What is the structure commonly overlies the carotid artery 
bifurcation?
o Facial vein off of IJ generally overlies the bifurcation
•	 What is the first branch of the external carotid artery?
o Superior thyroid artery
•	 Is the external carotid artery flow high or low resistance ?
o It is high resistance (flows to muscular facial muscles), so 
triphasic flow on doppler, brief reversal of flow
•	 Can the external carotid artery be ligated?
o External carotid can be tied off to help control excessive 
facial bleeding in trauma
•	 Internal carotid artery main blood supply to brain, first branch is 
the ophthalmic
o Low resistance as it is supplying brain tissue, so it has 
continuous forward flow which creates a biphasic doppler 
signal 
Doppler of the internal carotid is biphasic with a long 
diastolic phase, distinctly different than the high resistance of 
the triphasic external carotid

o Likely injury to vagus nerve
o From clamping the carotid the vagus nerve was also 
clamped
•	 Tongue deviation to side of injury?
o Likely hypoglossal nerve injury

be damaged
•	 Ipsilateral mouth droop after a carotid?
o Marginal mandibular injury
o From retraction on mandible, generally when trying to 
expose high lesions
•	 This nerve lies deep to posterior belly of digastric and if divided 
can cause disabling dysphagia .
o Glossopharyngeal

artery
o If already have neurologic injury/completed stroke unlikely to 
get better with intervention
o Antithrombotic therapy

how do you treat it?
o Subclavian Vein Thrombosis (Paget-Schroetter), 
compression at costoclavicular junction
o Treat with catheter directed thrombolysis followed by first rib 
resection within the same hospital stay or shortly after
•	 A young person with no atherosclerotic risks factors presents 
with ischemia of the hand
o Common presentation for arterial TOS, though arterial TOS 
is very rare
o Likely an anomalous cervical rib is compressing the 
subclavian artery and will lead to an aneurysm, which is an 
embolic risk
o Will need first rib resection with interposition graft for the 
artery
Subclavian Steal Syndrome
•	 Where is the anatomic stenosis that results in subclavian 
steal?
o Proximal subclavian narrowing
o Results in a reversal of blood flow in vertebral, which can 
lead to vertebrobasilar symptoms



---

<!-- Page 146 -->

146
11 VASCULAR
o Symptoms occur when extremity is exerted and it steals 
blood from cerebral circulation
•	 How do you fix it?
o Endovascular recanalization and stenting or potentially 
carotid subclavian bypass are subclavian transposition

Vas-Cath at many places) and why do they need to be 
removed?
o 3 weeks
o Infection risk
•	 How do long term tunneled catheters differ (Permacath)
o They are cuffed
o They are tunneled
o Lower risk of central infection 
o Still higher infection rate, and high risk of central venous 
stenosis compared with fistula or graft
•	 What is preferred location for temporary dialysis access and 
what should be taken into account?
o Right IJ direct to right atrium
o Avoid the side where you plan to place permanent AV Fistula
o Will cause central venous stenosis, will lead to failure of 
permanent access
•	 What is preferred location for AV fistula creation for dialysis 
access?
o “Fistula First” Always start distal on non-dominant arm, and 
upper extremities before lower extremities, Start distal to not 
burn bridges .
o Reducing catheter days, improves life expectancy
o Focus is now moving to choosing the right access for the 
right person, a person with a short life expectancy, a fistula 
may not be the best access

11 VASCULAR
•	 What is the most common reason for AV fistulas to malfunction 
over time?
o The major cause of hemodialysis AV access failure is venous 
outflow problems.
•	 A patient reports that she is having high venous return 
pressures, and increased bleeding after dialysis, what is 
the likely problem, how do you diagnose it and what is the 
treatment?
o Likely has venous outflow stenosis
o Can be diagnosed with duplex US
o Fistulogram with balloon angioplasty can likely correct the 
lesion
•	 What are criteria for fistula maturation, “Rule of 6s”?
o Needs to be 6 mm in diameter 
o <6 mm deep
o >600 mL/min in flow
•	 6 weeks after a brachio-cephalic fistula creation, the fistula 
fails to mature, what are some likely causes of this and how 
can they be managed?
o Possible inadequate inflow, rule out stricture at anastomosis, 
potential balloon angioplasty vs revision of anastomosis
o Competing flow from side branches, branches need to be 
ligated or coiled
A bleeding fistula with pinpoint hole bleeding can be 
treated with a stitch and urgent fistulogram. Bleeding 
from an ulcer on a fistula is a surgical emergency.

foot eversion .
•	 To access superficial posterior and deep posterior 
compartments?

is to make sure that the posterior deep compartment has 
been fully decompressed. Both the superficial and the deep 
posterior compartments are decompressed through the 
medial incision .
•	 How do you release the deep posterior compartment?

decide between end to end aortic anastomosis vs end to side 
anastomosis?
o Need to ensure flow into at least 1 internal iliac for pelvic 
perfusion
o If external iliacs are patent can perform end-end as patient 
will have internal iliac perfusion from retrograde flow
o If external iliacs are not patent can perform end-side 
anastomosis which will allow antegrade flow into internal 
iliacs assuming common iliacs are patent

point
• These must be fixed, as risk of rupture
• Generally place a cuff to seal more proximally or distally



---

<!-- Page 156 -->

156
11 VASCULAR
o Type II 
• Lumbars or IMA continue to fill aneurysm sac
• Only need to be fixed if aneurysm sac continues to grow
• Coil embolization of lumbars feeding sac is best treatment 
option
o Type III
• Components of the endograft are not sealed
• Must be fixed, as aneurysm sac will be pressurized
• Reinforce with cuff across previous interlap between 
components
o Type IV
• Porosity of graft, or a tear in the graft
• May need to reline the graft with new endograft
Peripheral Vascular Disease
•	 How do you calculate an ABI?
o Take which ever pedal pressure is the highest (DP or PT) 
and divide that by the highest brachial pulse (right or left 
arm)
•	 How to interpret an ABI?
o  .9  1 .4 is normal 
 
 .5   .89 may have claudication 
 
<0 .5 = May have rest pain 
 
<0 .3 = Tissue loss
•	 What if patient has non compressible vessels, can you rely on 
ABIs?
o No small vessel calcification will lead to falsely elevated ABIs
o Toes pressures should be obtained, as these vessels are 
generally free from calcification

157
11 VASCULAR
•	 A patient presents with claudication, how do you treat them?
o Smoking cessation, exercise, statin therapy
•	 What indications would you intervene on a patient with 
claudication

High yield! Do not offer operation for claudication, 
unless failed medical management and severe lifestyle 
impairment
•	 What options are there for imaging blood vessels
o CTA is good for proximal vessels to level of knee if kidney 
function ok
o If not angiography can use less contrast and visualize tibial 
vessels better
o Also can do C02 angiography if very poor renal function
o MRA is also an option
•	 What are essentials of operative planning in vascular surgery?
o Inflow, outflow and vascular conduit (if bypass)
•	 What are principles of deciding between treating a lesion 
endovascular vs open
o In general, endovascular interventions are best suited for 
lesions that are short and not heavily calcified. 
o Long occlusions that are densely calcified with good inflow, 
outflow and conduit are likely better treated with open 
bypass vs endarterectomy . 
o The common femoral artery is rarely treated with an 
endovascular approach because it is a mobile area that is 
prone to kinking and also because of the relative ease of an 
open approach .

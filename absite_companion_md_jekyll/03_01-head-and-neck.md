01 HEAD AND NECK
High Yield Anatomy
•	 Name the structures of the thoracic outlet from anterior to 
posterior
o Anterior to posterior – Subclavian Vein  Phrenic Nerve 
 Anterior Scalene  Subclavian Artery (SCA)  Middle 
Scalene
The phrenic nerve travels from lateral to medial on top of 
the anterior scalene as it courses into the chest.
•	 Name the boundaries and contents of the anterior and 
posterior neck triangles
o Anterior neck triangle
• Anterior boundary— Midline of the neck
• Posterior boundary — Sternocleidomastoid (SCM)
• Inferior (Apex) — Sternal notch
• Superior (Base) — Lower border of the body of the 
mandible
• Contents: Carotid Sheath
o Posterior Neck Triangle
• Anterior boundary — Posterior border of SCM
• Posterior boundary — Trapezius muscle
• Base — Middle 3rd of Clavicle
• Apex — Intersection of SCM and Trapezius 
• Contents: Spinal Accessory Nerve
o Anterior/Posterior triangles are broken up into smaller 
triangles, but these are not commonly tested
•	 What muscles does the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) 
innervate? How does the anatomy differ on the right side 
versus the left side?
o RLN branches off vagus nerve and innervates muscles of 
larynx (except for cricothyroid muscle, which is innervated by 
Superior Laryngeal Nerve)

o Right side: Vagus passes anterior to SCA and the RLN loops 
behind SCA and travels superiorly in Tracheoesophageal 
(TE) groove
o Left side: Vagus passes anterior to aortic arch between 
Left Common Carotid Artery and SCA and RLN then loops 
behind aortic arch and travels superiorly in TE groove
The superior laryngeal nerve innervates the cricothyroid 
muscle, all other laryngeal muscles are innervated by the 
recurrent laryngeal nerve
 
Head and Neck Cancers
•	 What is the most common head and neck cancer?
o Squamous cell cancer (SCC) 
o 5th most common Cancer overall; Men affected more than 
women 5:1
o Risk Factors: Alcohol and tobacco (Synergistic Effect), HPV
o Each subsite (e .g . oral cavity, oropharynx, nasopharynx, 
hypopharynx, larynx, nose, paranasal sinus, and 
salivary gland) has its own staging system and treatment 
recommendations . However, IN GENERAL:
• Stage I and II – Local disease (No regional or distant Mets)
• Stage III and IV – Either locally aggressive or distant mets
• Surgery or Radiation acceptable for stage I-II . Surgery vs . 
radiation will depend on location and morbidity of resection 
(e .g . WLE for intraoral lesions vs radiation for vocal cord 
lesions) .
• Multimodality required for Stage III-IV. Usually surgery 
(WLE + MRND) followed by radiation +/- chemotherapy
• Oral SCC >4cm (or + nodes/bone invasion) needs 
resection with MRND followed by postop radiation
•	 Are large or small salivary gland tumors more likely to be 
malignant, and what are the subtypes of the most common 
salivary malignant tumors?
o Tumors of small salivary glands more likely to be malignant

than larger glands (i .e . sublingual > submandibular > parotid)
o Malignant Tumors
• Mucoepidermoid Cancer – Most common
• Treatment  Resection (total parotidectomy with facial 
nerve preservation if parotid) with MRND, +/- postop 
XRT
• Adenoid Cystic Cancer 
• Slow growing with tendency to locally invade 
(particularly nerves)
• Tx: resection (total parotidectomy with facial nerve 
preservation if parotid) with MRND, +/- postop XRT
o Don’t need to aggressively resect Adenoid Cystic 
Cancer if it would result in high morbidity as it is 
very sensitive to XRT
•	 What are the principles of management of an unknown primary 
head and neck cancer tumor (i .e . regional metastasis to node 
without known primary)?
1. Thorough head and neck exam – included fiberoptic 
exam of nasopharynx and larynx
2. FNA of regional node or excisional biopsy
3. CT scan Head/Neck/Chest +/- PET
4. OR for direct laryngoscopy, esophagoscopy, and 
ipsilateral tonsillectomy, + biopsies directed by 
previous work-up
• Most common site of unknown primary is tonsil 
followed by base of tongue
• If no primary identified – will still need ipsilateral 
MRND and bilateral XRT
•	 How do you diagnose and treat a melanoma of the head and 
neck?
o Diagnose with full-thickness biopsy (excisional, incisional, or 
punch) – NO SHAVE BIOPSY!
o Staged like melanoma at other sites (See melanoma section)

o Treatment: Resection with the same margins as other sites if 
possible (1cm for lesions <1mm in depth and 2cm for those 
>2mm in depth)
• Tumor margins can be adjusted if abutting critical 
structures
• Branches of facial nerve should be preserved unless 
clinically involved
• Confirm negative margins prior to reconstruction
• Moh’s surgery also an option, especially if resection would 
result in morbidity
o Lymphadenectomy is required if regional nodes are clinically 
positive . 
o If clinically node negative  Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) for 
>1mm depth
o How to determine lymph node basin for melanoma of head/
neck  Primary lesions anterior to imaginary line from one 
tragus to the other will drain anteriorly through the parotid 
basin
• For anterior lesions  superficial parotidectomy and 
selective anterior neck dissection
• For posterior lesions  Selective posterior neck dissection
o Adjuvant therapy for melanoma is currently undergoing rapid 
advancement and recommendations may change in near 
future
• Adjuvant interferon alpha has been showed survival 
benefit in advanced disease, however it has many side 
effects and poorly tolerated
• Adjuvant radiation therapy may help with regional control, 
however has no survival benefit
• Ongoing trials for targeted therapies (monoclonal 
antibodies, oncogene inhibitors) are showing a lot of 
promise

Quick Hits
•	 Painless mass on roof of the mouth? 
o Torus Palatinus (overgrowth of cortical bone)
o Treatment? Do Nothing (resect if interfering with denture fit)
•	 Most common site for oral cavity cancer? 
o Lower lip (related to sun exposure)
o Will need flap reconstruction if > ½ lip resected
•	 EBV related H&N Cancer? 
o Nasopharyngeal SCC
o Treatment?  XRT
•	 MC malignant salivary gland tumor? 
o Mucoepidermoid carcinoma
•	 MC benign salivary gland tumor? And what is the treatment?
o Pleomorphic adenoma
o Superficial Parotidectomy (Do not enucleate this lesion)
•	 Gustatory sweating following parotidectomy? What is the 
cause of this?
o Frey’s syndrome
o Injury to auriculotemporal nerve that then cross innervates 
with sympathetic fibers
•	 Elderly patient with postop fever, pain, and swelling at angle of 
jaw? What is the organism and what is the treatment?
o Suppurative parotiditis
o Staphylococcus
o Hydration and antibiotics; I&D if abscess is present
•	 Management of bleeding at tracheostomy site? 
o Small amount  Bronchoscopy to rule out 
Tracheoinnominate fistula
o Large amount  Place finger into tracheostomy, hold 
manual pressure against sternum and go to OR emergently 
for median sternotomy and resection of innominate artery . 
Close tracheal side primarily and cover with strap muscle (do 
NOT put synthetic interposition graft . It will get infected and 
blow out) .

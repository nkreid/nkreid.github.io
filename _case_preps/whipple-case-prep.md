difficulty: "Complex"
attending_notes: "Dr. Alvarez prioritizes vascular control plans and post-op drain strategy."
time_goal: "Night-before run-through"
patient_profile: "68-year-old with pancreatic head adenocarcinoma, biliary stent in place."
high_yield_pearls:
  - "Confirm SMA and SMV involvement on cross-sectional imaging before committing to resection."
  - "Review variant hepatic arterial anatomy, especially replaced right hepatic artery."
  - "Discuss plan for pancreaticojejunostomy technique (duct-to-mucosa vs. dunk)."
workflow_steps:
  - "Pre-op briefing with anesthesia to coordinate central access and hemodynamic monitoring."
  - "Confirm availability of cell saver and vascular instruments."
  - "Explore abdomen, rule out metastasis, and mobilize hepatic flexure."
  - "Control gastroduodenal artery early and test hepatic arterial flow before transection."

pimp_questions:
  - question: "What are the key anatomic boundaries of the triangle of Whipple?"
    answer: "Cystic duct superiorly, common hepatic duct medially, and common bile duct laterally."
  - question: "How do you manage a soft pancreas with small duct intraoperatively?"
    answer: "Use duct-to-mucosa anastomosis with internal stent and reinforce with external sutures or dunk technique depending on texture."

## Mental Rehearsal Notes

Capture your own rehearsal script hereâ€”focus on vascular steps, reconstruction order, and bailout thresholds for conversion to vascular resection.

## Attending Pearls from Conference

- Review surgeon-specific anastomotic preferences during pre-op huddle.
- Clarify DVT prophylaxis restart timing because this attending prefers early postoperative anticoagulation.
